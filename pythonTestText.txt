Tucker doesn’t scream when the knife goes in but Epsilon does
He howls a long unbroken noooooooo that makes Tucker want to roll his eyes it’s that dramatic
The eye roll won’t quite come though
Between the ungodly pain in his torso Felix skulking in front of him and Epsilon raging inside his skull he doesn’t have room to focus on anything else
Oh my god Tucker Tucker are you okay why didn’t you listen to me I told you to stop I told you to wait oh that mercenary motherfucker I’m gonna kill him I’m gonna rip him apart with my bare fucking hands Tucker don’t you dare fucking die if you die I’m gonna kill you
Church shut the fuck up
Tucker sucks in a breath and tries to ignore Felix who is still pacing and yammering away
Focus
Focus on the helmet cam
Fuck the helmet cam
This is bullshit
Wash was right you should’ve taken his stupid healing unit
Tucker winces
Yeah
He’s gonna be pretty pissed at me
Pissed at you
He’s gonna KILL me
Church just come on
Play it cool
Okay okay I got it
When Epsilon takes off to distribute the data to the tower
Tucker I swear to god you’d better still be alive when I get back here
Tucker spends the next several minutes focusing on staying conscious
His friends are fine
They’re fine
They’re right there and he needs to get up he needs to help them
He tries to stand but the pain that lances through his abdomen has him biting back a scream and nope standing is most definitely off the table
Carolina must notice the way he flinches because she opens up a direct line to his radio
Hold on Tucker
Her voice has the same quiet reassuring quality that Wash’s does in a crisis and Tucker holds onto it listening to the even sound of her breath over the radio
Locus appears behind Felix’s shield at the same time that Church returns and both of these things jolt Tucker back to a full consciousness
Oh good
Epsilon doesn’t bother to disguise his relief
Alright I distributed the data so everyone on Chorus should know
Wash
He can feel Epsilon’s confusion
What
Wash Tucker thinks a little deliriously
He’s not here
Locus is here but he’s not
Church
Church what does that mean
Epsilon tries to mask his sudden realization and horror but he isn’t quite fast enough
A wave of grief pulses through Tucker so powerfully it almost knocks him over
Epsilon jolts in alarm
Hey we don’t know what happened yet you gotta stay with me- Tucker
Don’t you dare let those fucking mercenaries win this
Tucker rallies at these words even though he’s not sure who exactly Epsilon is reassuring gritting his teeth and forcing himself to stop scanning his friends
His friends all there except for Wash
Don’t you dare let them see you fall he tells himself sharply and he doesn’t he doesn’t not until Locus turns his back
Even then it’s a small thing his sword fizzling out of existence as he braces himself on one hand
No no no Tucker NO
Stay with me
He would
He should
His friends are right there and Wash might not yet be dead but his bones are so very heavy and
There is a moment between one slow blink and the next that Tucker thinks of three things
Running around in the first rainstorm Blood Gulch had seen in years all thoughts of armor and color-coded teams forgotten
Junior sleeping and serene curled up next to him in the sand
Wash laughing back at the crash site the dying red sunlight caught in his hair
The memories are bright and bold searing themselves onto the back of Tucker’s eyelids but there is no more time to make sense of them
Tucker falls
When Agent Washington wakes up it is to a room filled with buzzing beeping and breathing
Although he has not woken up in this particular room before he knows those sounds
Those beeps
He has only ever heard them when he was injured or sick or
Article Twelve something
Wash wakes up slowly piecing together the memories
He remembers a battle at the tower fighting with Locus collapsing in the dirt
He remembers making his way back to his team remembers Carolina slinging his arm over her shoulders to help him walk saying Wash there’s something He remembers stumbling over to where Tucker was lying on the ground remembers Epsilon flitting around their heads like a firefly remembers Dr Grey snapping at them all to get back
Remembers kneeling next to Tucker’s makeshift stretcher on the plane remembers being unaware of the fact that he was holding Tucker’s hand until one of the cadets had almost knocked him out of the way
Remembers Tucker’s eyelids cracking open he was conscious Wash remembers that he was awake and talking and then what
Wash frowns
He vaguely recalls the tilt and sway of the ship untilhad he passed out
Judging by the IV in his arm he must have
Adrenaline pumps through him and he shoots up in bed or tries to at least
A sharp pain sears across his ribs and he falls back with a yelp
Jesus
Take it easy
Wash glances around frantically until his eyes land on Epsilon a few feet away
The sight of the AI does absolutely nothing to reassure him
Epsilon
Where are we
What
Relax
Everything’s fine we’re in the capital
Armonia
With the good guys he emphasizes when Wash continues to stare at him blankly
But Wash frowns squinting in the dark until he realizes that Epsilon is sitting cross-legged on Tucker’s chest
Tucker is he
He’s fine Epsilon says quickly
Well
He’s really not but he will be
Surgery was a little dicey but he pulled through
How long has he been out
You guys were both out for over a day
Locus did a number on you
Wash nods bringing a hand to his ribs
Cracked again by the feel of them
His head is pounding something awful too
Where’s Carolina
Sleeping
Finally
Epsilon shakes his head
She and the guys just left not that long ago
I had to reassure them like a billion times that I wouldn’t let either of you die in your sleep
Buthow are you here then
Oh Epsilon shifts suddenly uncomfortable
I’m uh
Still wired to Tucker’s implants
I wanted toI meanit just seemed like a good idea to monitor him
And you
From over here
Fromacross the room
Just you know
Scans and stuff
To make sure you don’t like have a seizure
Or something
I see
The silence that falls between them is awkward and cold and Wash remembers another detail from the tower how he’d fallen to his knees next to Tucker in the dirt looked up at Epsilon and said This is your fault
Epsilon sighs breaking the silence
Look
You were supposed to account for his reaction time Wash says
That was the only reason that I agreed to keep the healing unit
The only reason
I know that
You said that you could handle the helmet cam and keep an eye on Tucker
You said
This whole plan was Tucker’s idea
Are you seriously blaming Tucker here
Of course not
Because it sounds like
Jesus Christ would you shut up and listen to me for one second
They glare at each other for a moment before Wash folds his arms over his chest
Fine
Explain
Tucker didn’t listen to me
Epsilon snaps
I saw what was about to happen and I told him to stop butLook
There was a moment where it looked like the guys and Carolina were in trouble
You know what Tucker’s like
He started running over to them and I couldn’t stop him not withoutyou know
Taking control
There’s a part of Wash that wants to tell Epsilon he should have taken control if it meant saving Tucker but he doesn’t mean it not really
He does mean it when he says The helmet cam wasn’t more important than Tucker’s life
Do you think I gave two flying fucks about the helmet cam
No
But Tucker did
He did
It was his stupid plan and his stupid helmet cam and if he hadif he hadlook it all would’ve been for nothing if we hadn’t gotten that message out and you know it
Wash says nothing just shakes his head and Epsilon matches him glare for glare
I know that I fucked this up Epsilon continues his avatar fizzling for a moment
Jesus Wash do you think that I don’t know that
You think I’m not over here doing the same goddamn thing you are
Thinking of every possible scenario
I can’t lose these guys Wash says abruptly because it’s true because he can’t because Epsilon probably knows it anyway because he can’t think about the scenarios because
Well shit Wash
Neither can I
Wash stares at the ceiling and tries to ignore Epsilon fidgeting in his peripheral
We made it again Epsilon says finally
Pulled it off
Wash sighs glancing over at Tucker’s still form
I just hope we’re out of the woods
They are not out of the woods
What do you mean he has a fever
Well generally when one has a fever it means that their body temperature
Agent Washington
You are still on bed rest
Wash ignores Dr Grey and limps over to Tucker’s bed
The short distance takes way more effort than it should which he also ignores
He puts a hand on Tucker’s forehead
He’s too warm he informs Dr Grey
Epsilon heaves a sigh
Yeah that’s what she just said genius he says annoyed but his tone doesn’t mask the anxious way he’s pacing across Tucker’s chest
But Wash frowns looking at Dr Grey almost pleadingly
But I thought he was going to be fine
You said he was going to be fine
And odds are he will be
Odds are
Odds are
Wash
What are you doing out of bed
Wash turns to see Carolina striding across the infirmary
Tucker has a fever he tells her and has to take a moment to remind himself that Carolina isn’t going to be able to fix this
Carolina frowns at Dr Grey
How can he have a fever
You said there wasn’t any infection
Tucker’s wounds are infected
Simmons is hovering in the doorway and takes a hesitant step inside when they all turn to face him
But isn’t that bad
A flesh-eating virus
Sarge pokes his head around the corner
What kind of nefarious organisms does this planet hold
No there’s no infection there’s no virus
There’s a virus going around
Grif’s alarmed voice sounds from around the corner and he shoves his way past Simmons and Sarge to stand at the foot of Tucker’s bed
Huh
He looks like shit
What kind of virus is it
There IS no virus
His wounds are infected Grif Simmons snaps
Honestly
Everyone shut up
Dr Grey shrieks and they all fall silent wincing
Well
This is a case of too many cooks in the kitchen now isn’t it
But none of us are cooks says Caboose earnestly who has just barreled into the room as well
Well Tucker is a good cook
Don’t tell him I said that
Anyway mutters Grif and Dr Grey claps her hands together
Now
Captain Tucker here has a fever
It’s probably just a teensy little thing that I can fix in a jiffy but I need all of you to leave
Why
Simmons says sulkily
Wash gets to stay
Agent Washington is recovering from a whole busload of super-fun injuries
Carolina wastes no time marshaling Wash back into bed at these words and Dr Grey wastes no time marshaling the rest out of the room
You too she says to Carolina
If there’s an update you’ll be the first to know
She slams the door in Carolina’s snarling face
By the time evening falls Caboose has managed to find a way back into the infirmary
He unseals his helmet and perches gingerly on the side of Wash’s bed
There’s a caution and uncertainty in his movements that confuses Wash until Caboose takes a deep breath
I would like to give you a hug Agent Washington
Oh Wash says and clears his throat
Um
WellI guessthat’s But Dr Grey says that if I hug you I might break you
I don’t think you’re going to break me Caboose
She says I hug too hard
Wash thinks that Dr Grey has a point but Caboose looks so dejected at the prospect that Wash can’t quite bring himself to agree
II like your hugs Caboose
Caboose’s whole face brightens
You do
Sure I do
But he adds hastily as Caboose makes a lunging motion
But uh
My ribs are still healing sotell you what
As soon as I’m out of the infirmary you can give me the biggest hug you want
Okay
Okay Caboose says happily and glances over at Tucker
Can I hug Tucker too
Of course you can Wash says biting his lips to keep from grinning
Tucker loves hugs
As if on cue there’s a groan from the other side of the room
Caboose almost falls off the bed in his haste to hover over Tucker and Wash isn’t far behind
Tucker’s eyes finally crack open flitting around the room before they zero on Wash’s face
Wash he croaks blinking
Caboose promptly knocks Wash out of the way
Tucker
You are awake
Oh god
Wait no I’m not
Let me go back to sleep
Dr Grey appears behind them so quickly that Wash has to physically stop himself from reacting
She shoulders Wash and Caboose out of the way and Wash is begrudgingly impressed by the force behind her shoulder check
’Scuse me Doctor coming through she says cheerfully and fiddles with Tucker’s monitors
Captain Tucker
How are you feeling
Like shit he mumbles
W’happened
Epsilon materializes over Dr Grey’s shoulder arms folded
You got stabbed that’s what
Nice going
Tucker falls silent contemplating this
Wash sees the exact moment Tucker pieces it all together but is too slow to prevent him from shooting up in bed
Tucker gasps falling back and clutching his stomach and Epsilon shoots a look at Wash as if it’s his fault
What is it with you two and not realizing you have to fucking take it easy after an injury
Wash Tucker says waving an arm around as if he’s looking for him
Wash steps up on his other side keeping a careful distance away from Dr Grey
Is everyone okay
Did we do it
Everyone’s fine Wash tells him
They’re all fine
Your plan worked we got the information out to everyone
You were stabbed and you caught a fever but you’re going to be okay
He glances at Dr Grey for confirmation and she nods
You’ll be fine as long as you in the words of your little AI friend take it easy she says
Little AI friend
Epsilon mutters but is quickly drowned out by Caboose’s shout of joy
Oh
Oh
Tucker
I will find us some board games we can play
Caboose claps Tucker so hard on the shoulder that Dr Grey looks within seconds of body checking him again but Caboose is out the door in a flash
Jesus mutters Tucker his eyelids already fluttering closed again
I’m gonna pretend to be asleep next time he comes back in
Tucker does in fact spend the rest of the day sleeping and Wash has to recount their brief conversation with Carolina then Grif and Simmons then Donut as they all wander in throughout the afternoon
By the time Sarge barges in he is thoroughly sick of telling the story
He’s fine Sarge he says tiredly as Sarge examines Tucker’s monitors
Hmph Sarge grunts in response
Dr Grey materializes out of seemingly nowhere to bat his hands away
Now now Colonel
No touching
Sarge looks at her appraisingly
I knew we had nothing to worry about with you on the case he says gruffly
Never seen hands quite like yours before
Weak Sarge Tucker groans from the bed and Wash finds himself exchanging a glance with Epsilon of all people who’s hovering over the nightstand in between their beds
Surgeon’s hands
Sarge blusters before he storms out of the room
Dr Grey glares at Tucker but finding his eyes still closed glares at Wash instead
What he asks defensively and she huffs her way out of the room as well
Call me if he starts bleeding through his bandages she yells as the door shuts
What the fuck was that
Tucker mumbles cracking an eye open
Wash sighs
You don’t want to know
I had to listen to those two flirting the entire time we were with the Feds
Nice Tucker says already starting to drift off again
Glad to see Sarge is getting some tail the sly old dog
Oh for God’s sake Tucker Epsilon says exasperated
But Tucker’s looking at Wash now fighting to keep his eyes open once more
He half lifts a hand before letting it fall and Wash finds himself doing the same thing without really knowing why
You’re okay though right
Tucker mumbles his voice thick with sleep
You’re really okay
Wash’s hand raises and falls once more and he clenches it in the bed sheets
I’m really okay
Everyone’s okay
Everyone’s okay says Wash and Tucker’s face relaxes his bones melting into the mattress as he drifts off
Tucker is noticeably better in the morning all traces of his fever gone
A group of four soldiers hover by the door around mid-morning trying to peer in but Dr Grey shoos them all away
No more visitors she says and Wash suspects she’s still irritated about Tucker scaring off Sarge earlier
Tucker rolls his eyes at Wash
The Lieutenants he says
I’ll introduce you to them all later
The next several days are much of the same
Tucker spends most of his time sleeping
Wash and Epsilon spend most of their time sitting in a begrudging silence
Caboose does indeed find some obscure board game that no one seems to know how to play but they play it anyway the four members of Blue Team with Caboose making up increasingly ridiculous rules and Epsilon shrieking about the absurdity of said rules
Wash is finally given permission to change out of the uncomfortable hospital gown into sweats and a t-shirt but Dr Grey laughs her way out of the room when Wash inquiries about his armor
Tucker whines so enthusiastically about the unfairness of the fact that Wash gets to lounge around in pajamas while I’m stuck wearing a paper dress and not even a sexy one that Dr Grey finally throws up her hands and helps him into something more comfortable as well
But if I have to operate quickly I’m ripping this shirt right open she says cheerfully
That’s okay baby I like the enthusiasm Tucker responds without missing a beat and Wash wouldn’t admit it out loud but he’s never been so happy to hear one of Tucker’s stupid come-ons
Tucker’s stupid come-ons mean that he is thinking of other things; that he is really and truly getting better
Wash wakes up one morning to find Tucker sitting cross-legged in his own bed datapad in hand deep in conversation with Epsilon
The change in him his astounding his eyes are bright the lines of his body strong
Dr Grey is nowhere to be seen
How are you feeling
Wash yawns pushing himself to a sit
To his surprise Tucker says nothing just grunts in response
Upon closer inspection Tucker’s healing body is not the only thing that has changed from days’ prior his whole demeanor is stiff and tense and he’s refusing to meet Wash’s eye
It’s nothing like the sleepy sanguine thing that’s settled itself in their room since their arrival here a thing that’s equal parts morphine and exhaustion and a giddy delirious joy that they are all alive
Tucker
I’m mad at you
Wash looks over at Epsilon who shrugs almost apologetically
I’m sorry what
I said I’m mad at you Tucker repeats
He still won’t look at Wash
And generally people don’t speak to the assholes that they’re mad at
Okay Wash says slowly
I mean if they’re five years old then yeah that sounds about right
Tucker whips around to glower at him and Wash is taken aback by the genuine anger in his eyes
This isn’t funny Wash
Wash holds up his hands
Alright alright
Look why don’t you tell me what you’re so upset about
If you don’t know then I don’t want to talk about it Tucker says stiffly
Epsilon throws up his arms
Oh my god
I’m logging off now
No you’re not Tucker snaps
Then I’ll have no one to talk to
It’s really fucking boring in this infirmary
Don’t understand why I can’t even walk around
That would be because you got stabbed Tucker Wash says
Tucker ignores him
And since we’re apparently about to have an argument I’d like to point out that your injury wouldn’t have been so bad if you’d taken my healing unit like I wanted you to
Tucker slams his datapad down onto the mattress glaring fiercely at Wash again
If I had then you’d probably be dead Wash
Wash blinks at him bewildered
I wouldn’t have been dead I just got banged up a little bit
Yeah by a total sociopath who clearly has it out for you
Tucker
I thought you were dead
Tucker is staring determinedly at the ceiling now while Epsilon looks around uncomfortably
When Locus came back without you
I thought you were dead
Tucker Wash says quietly
I thought you were dead too
When I came back when I saw you he stops and clears his throat and Tucker turns to him sharply
Yeah okay I’m really gonna go now Epsilon mutters and vanishes without further comment
When I came over that ledge and saw you on the ground Wash continues I thought that you hadn’t made it
That we’d lost the day
Tucker rolls his eyes
We wouldn’t have lost the day the plan worked didn’t it
" The plan wouldn’t have worked Wash says through gritted teeth if you had died
Hey that plan saved an entire planet and if what that takes is a little sacrifice
I don’t give a damn about the planet
The anger courses through Wash with no warning and overwhelming intensity
He’s on his feet without realizing that he’d intended to stand ignoring the throbbing pain in his ribs
I know you do but I don’t
I don’t
I don’t know these people and I’m not going to stand around and watch you risk your life for them
Don’t you fucking tell me what to goddamn do Washington
I can risk my life for whoever the fuck I want
I’m a fucking Captain now if you haven’t heard you’re not the boss of me anymore
I’m not trying to be the boss of you
I’m trying to keep you from taking unnecessary risks
Oh
Oh but it’s okay for you to do risky things with your life
Tucker is matching Wash scowl for scowl but there’s something triumphant in his eyes as well some ill-disguised pleasure that he’s gotten Wash to scream right back
I don’t
Wash rakes a hand through his hair
What the hell are you talking about
Oh my God
Tucker swings his legs to the edge of the bed so that he can glare at Wash more effectively
Are you fucking kidding me right now
No I’m not kidding you
You looked right at me
I what
Wash stops pacing for a moment staring at Tucker in confusion
Tucker’s got his hands balled into fists jaw clenched furiously
When you told Freckles to shake Tucker says lowly
You looked
Right
At me
I was right there and you were on your feet and it would’ve taken me two seconds to come over and help you
You don’t know that
Yes I fucking do
Tucker yells it so loudly that footsteps passing outside the hallway falter
Yes I fucking do he says again lowering his voice
I do
But god forbid you let a day go by where you’re not careless with your own life
Wash jerks back
I’m not careless with my life
Yes you are
You’d rather risk getting tortured by some fucking nut job than let people help you
Something about the way Tucker phrases this gets under his skin
That’s not
Wash takes a deep breath before looking Tucker square in the face
I needed to know that you and Caboose were safe
Tucker scoffs turning away and Wash steps directly into his line of vision
I will never apologize for saving your life so if that’s what you’re going for here
You still don’t get it
Tucker bursts out and he tries to stand fiddling with the IV still in his arm
Tucker
Wash holds out a hand to stop him and Tucker bats it away
What did I just say
Don’t tell me what to do
If you get to pace around the room dramatically then so do I
Wash winces as Tucker stumbles back onto the bed with a gasp and he takes a seat on his own bed again giving them the much needed space
There
I’m sitting
Now will you take it easy
You’re gonna pull your stitches
I don’t fucking care about my stitches Tucker spits
Well I do
They glare at each other
Wash is surprised that no one has come storming into their room yet
Tucker
Tell me what I still don’t get
Tucker huffs glaring at a point somewhere over Wash’s left shoulder
We thought you were being tortured he says
What
I know you heard what I just said don’t act fucking stupid
Tucker snaps flaring again immediately
Jesus jumped up Christ
Alright alright
Tucker breathes heavily through his nose until he’s satisfied that Wash isn’t going to interrupt
After you oh-so-heroically collapsed that wall
We
Grif Simmons Caboose and I thought you guys were in serious trouble
The things that Felix he spits out the name  told us about Locus and his douchey friendsthey didn’t sound good
Wash stays silent and waits for Tucker to continue
Tortured Tucker repeats
Okay Wash says slowly
He can’t help but feel that he’s still missing something and judging by the way Tucker’s eyes are boring holes into him Tucker clearly thinks so too
Tucker
I got two people killed Tucker says
On a mission
I was following a lead to where you guys were andtwo men got killed in the process
It was my fault
There’s a haunted look in Tucker’s eyes that tells Wash he still isn’t past it
I’m sorry
Apparently this is the wrong thing to say because Tucker starts yelling again
Don’t fucking apologize
I don’t want to hear you say you’re sorry ever again
Tucker
And don’t say my name either
Wash is started to get frustrated now
Well what the hell do you want from me
I want you to get it
Get what
Tucker pulls at his dreads with a growl flopping dramatically back down on the bed (which can’t be good for his stitches Wash notes with disapproval) to stare at the ceiling
I thought you were being tortured
So you’ve said I thought you were being tortured Tucker continues loudly ignoring Wash and I couldn’tI couldn’t fucking think straight
I couldn’t eat
I couldn’t get any goddamn sleep because all I kept thinking of all night was how you don’t sleep on a good day and how you were probably having the shittiest nightmares ever in some torture dungeon and we weren’tI wasn’t Wash holds his breath unwilling to move or make a sound
There Tucker says finally
I
Wasn’t
There
Silence
And then Tucker continues furiously sitting up
We meet up again find you guys like all whole and shit and what’s the first thing you do
He seems to be waiting for Wash to speak but Wash finds himself slightly terrified of giving the wrong answer
Um
You try to sacrifice yourself heroically again
Tucker flops sideways back down on the bed legs hanging off the side and deepens his voice
There’s a fourth option
Carolina and I will handle the bad guys and the rest of you can fuck off
That’s not
Wash can’t keep quiet any longer
That’s not what I meant and you know it
That’s exactly what you meant
It had nothing to do with you guys as fighters
I didn’t want any of you to get hurt in a war that isn’t yours
It isn’t your war either
Tucker shouts
He’s still yelling at the ceiling
You just said that you didn’t give two flying fucks about this planet
Well I do
And at least my plan actually had a chance of working unlike the crock of shit you pulled out of your ass
That isn’t
And guess what
My fucking plan did work and you just have your panties in a fucking knot because I got wounded well you know what Wash
That’s what happens in war
People get hurt
You’re not people Wash grits out
You’re my team
You’re myfriend
So what
That makes me more important than a whole fucking planet
Wash doesn’t have to think about it
Yes
Tucker sighs loudly
That’s fucked up Wash
I don’t care
So you’re willing to sacrifice yourself and Epsilon and Carolina but not me
Or Caboose
Or the Reds
Wellthat’s not what That’s exactly what you tried to do
Jesus Christ Wash you’ve got some fucked up priorities
Tucker falls silent for nearly a minute and when he speaks again his voice is low and hurt
Your plan was shitty and mine wasn’t and it worked and it saved the fucking day
I know it did Wash says surprised
Is that what this is about
Tucker groans dragging a pillow over his face
No that’s not what it's about
Haven’t you been listening to me
It’s about you and this fucking thing you do where you’re careless with your stupid life and don’t give a fuck about how it affects other people
Okay okay Wash says hastily
Tucker whips the pillow away and glares at him
I really need you to get that dude
Okay okay Iget it
Tucker snorts turning to glare at the ceiling once more and Wash can tell he didn’t buy it for a second
Whatever
Still though Wash continues because it’s important that Tucker understand this I’m not denying that it was a good plan
I’m proud of you
You are
Wash sighs
Tucker look at me
Tucker doesn’t look at him just remains flopped on his bed staring unblinkingly at the ceiling
Wash hesitates then gets up sitting next to Tucker
I may have fucked up priorities he says quietly and I may want nothing more than to get all of us off this planet
Tucker snorts again and Wash pretends he doesn’t see the bright sheen covering his eyes
But he continues
If this is important to you guys then you have my support
Really
Wash hesitates then stretches on his back to lay sideways next to Tucker hoping it might startle him into looking meeting his gaze
Really
It works
Tucker sniffs loudly and tilts his head to look at Wash eyes bright and furious and unyielding
Okay ‘cause half the people in this army are like fifteen and I just think it’s really unfair and I know we’re not the best soldiers but I think we could help and if we could help then just think what you and Carolina could do
Looks like you guys have been doing just fine without us Wash says smiling a little
But you won’t have to do it alone
Not anymore
Promise me something Tucker says abruptly
Okay
He looks a little suspicious at the ease of Wash’s answer
We’re a team right
That’s what you’re always fucking saying anyway
Of course we are
Okay then
You have to fucking treat us like a team
No more trying to keep us out of the line of fire
No more self-sacrificial bullshit
Wash nods
That’s fair
I mean it Tucker says his voice fierce again
If we’re on a mission or something and you’re in trouble you have to fucking radio me so that I can come help you
Wash is used to the way that memories slam into him removing him unforgivingly from the present
This one though comes slow and sorrowful another infirmary another teammate
You lie
You’re a liar
You say you’re fine when you’re not
You say you don’t need backup when you do
You have to radio me when you need help
It’s the only way this works
Maine’s voice grumbles through his skull from far beyond the grave
For him and for Tucker Wash thinks it might be time to listen
Promise he says and holds out his hand
Tucker rolls his eyes but shakes it
I never meant to imply that you guys weren’t capable you know he says
I justI don’t want to see you hurt
I know Tucker says with a sigh
I know you don’t
But still
If you pull any bullshit like that ever again I will kill you myself
Deal
There’s an unshed tear clinging to Tucker’s eyelashes and Wash has to quash down a sudden and insane urge to brush it away
He clenches his fist and focuses on Tucker on the promise that he needs to make
Deal
Tucker grins and in that moment Wash realizes that he can’t just say the words and not think of their consequences
He has to mean them
He has to change
The thing about getting injured in a war Tucker thinks is that it’s really fucking boring
It was kind of nice at first once he was sure he wasn’t about to die and all
There’d been an awful lot of people sneaking into his room to look at him like he was a goddamned hero
Which he was of course
He’d really played up the wounded soldier card and he was pretty certain it was going to get him a lot of tail
Okay Caboose had been extra clingy and Grif had stolen his jello cup twice now but Sarge had rigged his morphine drip so that he slept soundly and Wash had been all worried and clench-jawed in a way that was somehow not annoying after they’d had their stupid heart to heart and gotten all emotional and shit
Now though Tucker doesn’t think he can stand lying in this bed for another second
It isn’t fair he thinks morosely
Wash had been almost as fucked up as him but he was now allowed out of the infirmary with the caveat of overnight observations for the next few days
Tucker isn’t sure why he’d even bothered leaving
Wash had already popped back in four times it wasn’t even noon clearly convinced that Tucker was going to bleed out and no one would notice
Which was absurd
He wasn’t going to die bleeding out; he was going to die of boredom
Oh my god are you ever gonna stop feeling sorry for yourself
Epsilon sounds nearly as cranky as Tucker feels but Tucker will not be out-sulked
Come out here
I hate talking to you when I can’t see you I know you know that
He gestures towards the monitor on his bedside table that Caboose had scrounged up from God-knows-where
"This is here for a reason you know
So I can see you
" Yeah well too bad
Church he whines
Come on
I’m sooo fucking bored
Tell me a story or something
Epsilon materializes on Tucker’s knee folding his arms in exaggerated annoyance
Tell you a story
What am I your nurse
Uh why the fuck else are you camped out in my head
In case you’ve forgotten Epsilon says in the most condescending voice Tucker’s ever heard you got stabbed and someone needs to keep an eye on your stupid ass
Tucker grunts
They don’t seem too worried anymore
No one’s been in here to poke and prod at me all goddamn day
Yeah that’s ‘cause I’m here idiot
Huh
To keep an eye on you Epsilon emphasizes
Make sure you don’t croak
What are you gonna do if that starts to happen
Tucker asks sarcastically
Run for help
Actually I’m going to broadcast an SOS onto every computer on this goddamn planet until every doctor gets their ass in here Epsilon says calmly
But you know
Maybe I’ll run for help while I’m at it
He still sounds like a cocky little shit but Tucker gets the feeling that he’s not joking
Not in the slightest
He remembers the way Church screamed when the knife slid into his stomach so neat so sharp the blood ribboning out onto the ground Felix’s voice filling his ears and Wash hadn’t come back hadn’t
Tucker forces his thoughts away
Epsilon ignores the increased pattering of his heart for which Tucker is grateful but of course can’t resist throwing his two cents out there
That was way too fucking close Tucker
It has to be at least the seven hundredth time he’s expressed this sentiment and Tucker sighs loudly
I knooow
I’m just saying
You can’t drop your guard like that when
I know
Tucker bounces his fist against the mattress restlessly
I fucking know that
You really think I don’t
I just Panicked
So much for ignoring Tucker’s anxiety
Look how the fuck would you know anyway
You’re not a combat assist AI
Oh and you know that from your extensive experience with AI
Tucker opens his mouth reply scathingly but pauses
Are you
Well not exactly but they weren’t pairing us up with the Freelancers to do desk work I can tell you that much
Epsilon’s voice goes even sulkier the way it always does when Freelancer comes up but Tucker knows better than to ask for details
I know it was close okay
Still don’t need you to lecture me on combat
Epsilon shrugs
I’m sure Carolina will take care of that all on her own
Tucker straightens in alarm
You wouldn’t
If you fucking tell on me
I don’t have to
I guarantee you she’s already got one hell of a lecture prepared
How do you know
We share a head remember
She’s always griping about how you guys have the shittiest training ever
Hey Tucker says offended we’ve gotten by this long haven’t we
Exactly
Imagine how terrifying you would all be if you actually trained
Epsilon freezes in horror
Oh god
I sound like her don’t I
’ Starting to yeah
Fucking Christ
Epsilon falls silent for a while seemingly to reflect on this disturbing similarity and Tucker goes back to thinking about how bored he is
I should’ve
Epsilon starts then cuts himself off
Look
I should’ve at the tower
I should’ve Tucker sighs
Are we about to have a moment
Should’ve been faster Epsilon mutters
You were plenty fast
Tucker pauses then grudgingly continues
I didn’t listen
Don’t tell Wash I said that
Or Carolina
Or Dr Grey
Or anyone
Then I really will be in training for the rest of my life
Yeah Epsilon mutters but he doesn’t sound convinced
Now who’s feeling sorry for himself
Tucker quips then sighs again when Epsilon’s presence continues to sit like a stone in his skull
Look dude
There wasn’t anything you could’ve done okay
I didn’t listen
I guess I’msorry
For that
Or whatever
Epsilon looks at him sharply
Sorry
Why
Tucker shifts uncomfortably
You’re in my head aren’t you
Can’t you fucking tell
Don’t make me spell this shit out
When Epsilon continues to look confused Tucker lets his mind go loose and heavy
He thinks of Wash and Tex and failure and Wyoming’s time distortion unit and hopes Epsilon won’t ask him to elaborate because he couldn’t explain it if he tried
Epsilon seems to get it though and his presence lifts slightly
He doesn’t say sorry again and neither does Tucker but the atmosphere shifts and Tucker thinks this isn’t all bad thinks Freelancer might have been onto something before it all went to hell
Unfortunately Epsilon isn’t wrong about Carolina
About two hours after Wash comes to check on him again and bring him some ridiculous magazine he found on guns for some light studying and one hour after Dr Grey gives him his antibiotics and thirty minutes after Caboose comes in to tell him and Church exactly what he ate for lunch Carolina makes her grand entrance
Well it’s less of a grand entrance and more like a terrifying execution of stealth literally one moment he’s cracking jokes with Epsilon and the next Carolina is looming in his doorway in full armor but it’s as grand an entrance as Tucker’s ever seen
We need to talk she says ominously about your training
Epsilon clears his throat pointedly and Tucker sees her visor tilt in his direction before she straightens and makes an obvious attempt to soften her tone
How are you feeling Tucker
Jesus Christ Tucker mutters
It appears that you arehealing well
I am glad
Oh boy
Captain Tucker
Carolina pauses
It’sCaptain now right
Fuck yeah it is
Right
Captain Tucker
Your plan saved an entire planet
It
Tucker sighs
Okay okay
As much as I like hearing about what a goddamn hero I am I think I’d like to get the lecture over with fine
Carolina takes a few more steps into his room then another few until she’s hovering over his bed
On second thought maaaybe some more hero worship wouldn’t be the worst thing in the world
Tucker
What were you thinking
Tucker frowns
What happened to Captain Tucker
Carolina ignores him
Your plan was a brilliant one save for one key detail
I’m waiting with baited breath
You don’t know how to use that sword
Hey
Yes I do
Fine
You don’t know how to use it well Carolina amends
Tucker sighs loudly
I fail to see how that’s relevant
You fail to see how that’s relevant
Tucker one of the key elements of your plan was holding Felix off with your sword
I seem to remember some ridiculous monologue about ‘The Sword Fight of the Century
’ Look he pulled that knife out of nowhere
And you ran right into it
Tucker huffs and folds his arms protectively over his midsection
Get to the point
The point says Carolina
Is that if you insist on wielding that ridiculous sword in combat you need to learn how to use it
Immediately
But it wasn’t even a sword that Felix stabbed me with
Tucker cries frustrated
It was a knife
Swords
Knives
Things with blades plasma or otherwise
You need to learn how to use all of them
I know how to use them Tucker mutters and Epsilon rolls his whole head
Oh stop whining
Don’t talk to me about whining you
Look Carolina interrupts loudly
Her voice softens somewhat when Tucker scowls at her
I’m not saying you don’t have raw talent
I’m just saying that you’ve never had a chance to refine that talent
Imagine what you could do if you actually trained
Shut up Tucker tells Epsilon as the AI starts snickering inside his head
To Carolina he says Look I’m not sure what you think we were doing while the two of you were off fucking around
Epsilon stops snickering immediately
Oh come on
I already said I was sorry for that but TRAINING was pretty much the only goddamn thing we were doing
He frowns at Carolina
I’m not dicking around here
I don’t want these kids to die you know
Then you need to be better
No stop interrupting me and listen to what I’m saying
You have the talent
You have the drive
You just need someone to teach you
Stop feeling sorry for yourself Epsilon adds
Tucker huffs
Yeah
You got a master swordsman on this planet who’s gonna teach me
Carolina either completely misses his sarcasm or chooses to ignore it
I’m still looking
There has to be someone on this base who is good with a sword
I can help clean up your footwork but you do need a master
For now though you can start training knives with Wash
What with Wash
You’re sentencing me to more training with Wash
Wash is excellent with knives Carolina says undaunted and Tucker tries to remember if he’s ever even seen Wash use them
His aim is near perfect and his close quarters combat is
Is fucking shitty
Carolina
It’s a miracle Locus didn’t kill him
And I will be helping Wash set his training goals next she says fiercely
Do you think you’re the only one who needs to develop their skill set
Tucker pauses
So
I’m not the only one getting a lecture
Sarge needs to learn not to be so careless with his ammo Simmons has to keep a cooler head under pressure Grif needs to use his size to his advantage Caboose should be using his strength and Wash her voice drops dangerously
Wash needs to develop some sort of strategy for when he loses his weapons
Tucker feels marginally better at that
However Carolina continues
He is excellent with knives
When he doesn’t lose them
So until I can track down a swordsman you will be training with Wash in the mornings
Sucks to be you dude Epsilon snickers and Carolina rounds on him
And you need to learn to keep your head in a crisis and not panic every time one of your teammates sustains an injury
Epsilon sputters indignantly
What low C
Fucking low
Her voice softens a little
You boys did good
You completed your objective
I justyou could be better
I need you all to be better
Tucker’s tempted to argue the point further but Epsilon whispers grudgingly She’s trying to take care of you guys
Just let her so he relents
Okay okay fine
Good
Rest up
We have a war to win
Yeah yeah
He straightens up as she turns to leave
Wait
Are you gonna yell at Wash next
Aw come on can I watch
Goodbye Captain Tucker she says exasperated and the door swings shut behind her
The rest of the day passes slowly
Tucker gets a few more visitors which he likes because at least they give him something to do
He doesn’t even mind when Palomo stops by because it’s better than dwelling on the reason he’s in this bed in the first place
Epsilon doesn’t comment on the way Tucker goes quiet whenever he replays the stabbing in his mind even though Tucker knows Epsilon can feel the sickeningly way his stomach swoops
Instead he gets extra chatty and Tucker wonders if this is the real reason he’s here
He suddenly doesn’t think his lack of nightmares since the tower is a coincidence
Wash comes back in the early evening and Tucker brightens at the sight of him walking through the door
Oh good you’re back
I’m bored
Epsilon sighs
And here I thought I was a winning conversationalist
How was your first day of freedom
Tucker asks which Wash promptly ignores in favor of his own question
How are you feeling
Wash asks just like he’s been doing every time he walked into the room
As if Tucker’s going to drop dead at any moment
Jesus when are gonna stop asking me that
You’re not out of the woods yet Wash says darkly and couples his words by dramatically unsheathing his weapons and placing them on his bedside table
Uh are you expecting to be attacked tonight
We’re in a war zone Wash says
And seeing as how Dr Grey wouldn’t let me put my armor back on just yet I didn’t have much of a choice
Tucker glances pointedly at the knives on the table
She gave you your weapons back though
These aren’t my knives
I got them from the armory
Tucker watches him adjust the knives on his table just so
His shoulders are high and tight face drawn and unhappy
That bad of a day huh
It was fine Wash snaps and Tucker lets it go
Wash does a bit more unnecessary stomping around and rearranging of his weapons before he sits down on the edge of his bed and looks at Tucker
So
Are you okay
Yeah yeah
Did you read the magazine
Yeah Tucker says
Yeah
Good stuff in there
It’s a lie the weapons magazine was three years old but his words bizarrely seem to lift a bit of the tension out of Wash’s body
So Carolina wants me to teach you how to use knives Wash says and Tucker groans
Yep
One more goddamn thing I gotta learn
He pauses grinning
Does that mean you got a lecture too
You could say that Wash says dryly
Apparently she thinks my hand-to-hand skills need work
She’s not wrong Tucker can’t resist adding
Wash sighs
I know
We’ve all got stuff we need to work on
Now look I don’t pretend to be an expert at knives but I have a few tricks I could show you
Yeeeeeeah I bet you do Tucker crows and Epsilon makes a noise of disgust
Once you’re healed Wash continues loudly
We’ll get started
I’m going to book us a section of the training room for us six days a week
Six days a week
To learn how to use a fucking knife
It’s going to be more than just knife work Tucker Wash says
Eventually we’ll have to find a swordsman for you and we can always work on things like aiming and
Hand to hand combat
Wash levels a glare at him
And hand to hand combat
’Kay
Long as we’re working on your weaknesses too
Wash rolls his eyes suddenly superior
Tucker please
My worst sparring day easily tops your best
Oh really
We’ll see about that
Have you become a martial arts master while I was gone
I became a Captain didn’t I
Stranger things have happened
True Wash concedes
Agent Washington
They both turn to the door as Dr Grey bounces in
Well you did come back
Seems like juuuuust yesterday I was chasing you all over the Federalist compound trying to do a simple checkup and now you can’t stay away from the infirmary
Tucker lifts an eyebrow as Wash’s cheeks darken
What do you need Doctor
Let’s take a quick peek at those ribs shall we
Off with the shirt
Wash lifts his shirt slowly just enough for Dr Grey to get a look at his side and Tucker winces a little at the bruising still coloring his ribs
It’s faded to yellow at least but the sheer size of it is alarming
Tucker thinks it might be worse than the broken ribs he had after Sidewinder
How many times have you cracked your ribs dude
Tucker asks jokingly
Is this your go-to injury or what
Four Wash says absently and Tucker stops grinning
Four
You’ve broken your ribs four times
Wash blinks at him confused
Well yeah
Five says Epsilon absently
Tucker winces as Wash freezes
Excuse me
Epsilon apparently hasn’t realized he’s said anything odd yet and continues
There’s now and apparently after Sidewinder I wasn’t there for that but there was also that one time in Freelancer when you and CT got all banged up
Church shut the fuck up
Tucker hisses as Wash’s face slowly turns stonier and stonier
And then that time in Basic when you took that nasty kick to the side and then on your tour inthe Epsilon finally trails off as Tucker’s thoughts grow more insistent
Oh
Uh
Fuck
My bad Are you finished
Wash asks coldly
Or is there any other personal information of mine you’d like to share with the class
Nope
I think I’m uh good
Yeah
Think I’m good
‘Night everyone Epsilon says and logs off so fast that it leaves Tucker reeling slightly
Wash is still glaring at the place where Epsilon vanished but he is at least distracted enough that Dr Grey is able to finish her observation
Well that was awkward Tucker jokes as Dr Grey runs a scanner over Wash’s torso
Now Wash is glaring at him so Tucker gives it up
Wash throws back his covers and punches his pillow into a comfortable shape then proceeds to lay down and glare at the ceiling for the remainder of Dr Grey’s checkup
You’re free to go in the morning Washington she says cheerfully
I’ll do one final checkup but I think you’re healing nicely
Just take it easy for a few days
Wash grunts in acknowledgment as the door swings shut and Tucker rolls his eyes a little
Dude chill
I am
You are not
You’re wound up as fuck
Wanna talk about it
That gets Wash to look over at him
Talk about what Tucker
Aboutyou know Tucker sighs
Never mind
So did you get to meet everyone today
Yes
I meanwell some of them
Some of them
I just Wash fidgets
Look Dr Grey wouldn’t give me my armor okay
I’m not about to go wandering around a foreign environment without armor
Soyes
Some of them
So none of them Tucker thinks exasperated but he lets it go
He listens to the sounds of Wash tossing and turning before drifting into a light doze or at least pretending to
It wouldn’t surprise Tucker in the slightest if Wash hadn’t slept a wink since arriving in the capital
There are still times when it seems that nothing has changed since Rockslide since Wash was tense and tired and so utterly done
Moments where Tucker still catches him flinching at an unexpected touch or sees his face go blank and expressionless
Moments where he is distant and short and angry where Tucker realizes that he still has miles and miles to go
But he thinks of the way Wash brought him that stupid magazine and told him it was so that he could study which was a lie because all of the guns in that issue were out of date and he knows that Wash knew that
He thinks of how Wash just wanted him to have something to do because he knew Tucker was bored but he didn’t know how to say it
He thinks of how far Wash has come and of drinking beer on his birthday back at Rockslide and of protecting my friends and the way he had laughed that one time when
I thought of him he realizes suddenly the thought unfurling inside his sleepy mind like blue skies cut from clouds
I thought of him
Tucker straightens up in his bed glancing over at Wash dozing in the bed a few feet away
Holy shit he breathes
Epsilon stirs
What’s up
You feelweird
Shut up for a second
I’m thinking
Uh okay
But Epsilon does fall silent watching Tucker’s thoughts play out
Tucker thinks again of the stabbing but this time he traces the memory further the moment after he’d fallen into the dirt right before everything had gone black
He’d thought of something then of The canyon wet with rain for the first time in years
Junior in his teal armor curled up next to him in the desert
And Wash laughing with the early evening sun turning his blond hair red
I thought of him he says to Epsilon
I thought of Wash
Church why did I think of Wash
Shit I don’t know Tucker people think of all sorts of things when they think they mightyou know
Tucker turns the moment over and over in his head replaying it from every angle until he starts to drift off to sleep
I thought of him
I thought of Wash
Holy shit
Wash can’t quite shake the feeling that he’s forgotten something
He manages to drift off into a light doze but after less than two hours of fitful tossing he finds himself jolting up right from some half-remembered dream
The feeling of terror is only intensified by the fact that there’s something wrong
There’s something that he’s done or forgotten to do and if he doesn’t fix it then
His frantic gaze lands on the knives resting neatly on the table between his bed and Tucker’s
Knives
Weapons
That he brought into a room that he was currently sharing with someone he cared about
Guilt and trepidation work their way into his bones as Wash swings his feet to the floor
What had he been thinking
He has to move them the knives
They can’t stay here with him what if he’s having a nightmare and Tucker tries to wake him up and he and he
Wash is halfway to the door with the knives held carefully in his arms when a voice calls him back
And just where the fuck are you going
Wash turns around slowly to see Epsilon standing on the night table with his arms folded
I have to move these Wash says
I can’t
I might
Tucker
I don’t know what I was
I have to move them
What two hours ago you couldn’t get them in here fast enough
Epsilon says bewildered
Just go back to sleep everything’s fine
You’ll forgive me if I don’t take your word on that Wash snaps his voice sharpened by weeks of exhaustion and stress
I shouldn’t have brought these in here while I was sleeping I Wash
I don’t know what I was thinking he mutters hugging the knives closer to his chest
I just if someone comes in here I wanted to be able to I have to protect Tucker he wants to say but doesn’t
I have to protect all of them
But he has to protect them from himself and he can’t believe he’s forgotten that
Could you be any more dramatic
Epsilon snaps and Wash realizes that he’s spoken the words out loud after all
Jesus you’re not gonna hurt any of them
I have though Wash says
I have
I after SidewinderTucker tried to wake me up and he and I Tucker bending over him dark eyes wide and terrified shaking his shoulders and Wash remembers grabbing him slamming him to the ground getting his hands around Tucker’s throat
Tucker had struggled then pawed weakly at his arms before his body had started to still under Wash’s hands and if Caboose hadn’t
Wash still thinks of that moment and how it was almost the end for him the end of his sanity the end of any possible hope of redemption
If Caboose hadn’t come in and pulled him away and backed him against the wall so hard that the base seemed to rattle then Wash knows something in his head would’ve splintered beyond repair forever
I just have to get rid of these Wash says and if his voice shakes his hands don’t
I just I just have to
I don’t know what I was thinking
He ducks out of the room and pads carefully along the base until he finds a dusty alcove that he can dump the knives into
Epsilon is still sitting quietly on the nightstand when Wash returns and he waits until Wash climbs back into bed before speaking
I didn’t know you had nightmares that got that bad
Well why would you
Wash says irritated
You haven’tthis is the first time you’ve really been around since I was sleeping
No it’s not Epsilon protests
When we were all going to take down the Director
I saw you slept then
He pauses
That sounded way less creepy in my head
Wash rolls his eyes at the ceiling
No you didn’t
But
I wasn’t sleeping; I was keeping an eye on you and Carolina
He glances over at Epsilon who is still fidgeting on the nightstand
Why does this matter anyway
It doesn’t Epsilon says quickly and falls silent for so long that Wash thinks he’s finally logged off
Another glance over proves that this isn’t the case
What
I just Epsilon shrugs
I just didn’t know
That you had nightmares now
I didn’t know
That’sthat’s all
Well you should
What did you expect
It’s your fault that they’re so bad in the first place
The unsaid words hang heavy in the air and after several tense seconds Wash sighs and lets them go
Epsilon disappears in the brief moment between one blink and the next the blue light of his projection winking out and plunging the room into darkness
The following morning Wash is exhausted and cranky and utterly unwilling to start the day
The strange guilty way that Tucker and Epsilon jump when he rolls over does nothing to bolster his mood
Epsilon must have told Tucker about the way he’d woken up and dispensed of the knives
Morning Wash
Tucker says his voice so bright and jaunty that Wash sits up in alarm
What’s wrong
Nothing’s wrong
Sleep well
I he glances at Epsilon who makes a series of head shakes and hand gestures that Wash is apparently supposed to be able to interpret
Uh
 yeah
Whydo the two of you look so weird
Your face is weird Epsilon mutters and gives up the hand gestures
Dude where did the knives go
Tucker asks glancing at the nightstand with a frown
He genuinely appears to have just noticed that they’re missing and Wash slants a suspicious look at Epsilon
IDr Grey didn’t want any weapons in the infirmary
She took them away early this morning
Oh
Right Tucker mutters distractedly
No weapons
Makes sense
He still looks inexplicably guilty and Wash frowns
You lookweird
What happened
Christ Wash we were sleeping all night what could possibly have happened
Tucker snaps
There’s definitely something up and Wash sits up a little straighter suddenly guilty himself
He’d been so focused on not having nightmares himself that he hadn’t given much thought to what Tucker might be going through
Have you been having nightmares
What
Oh Tucker adopts a more somber tone
Yeah
Yeah
Nightmares
Lots of them
Fucking shitty nightmares
This does nothing to assuage Wash’s guilt
You should’ve woken me up
What
Dude
Then we both would’ve been sitting here awake like a couple of assholes
Wash shifts uncomfortably
I’m sorry Tucker
I don’tI’m surprised I didn’t hear you I don’t normally sleep so soundly
Wash shut the fuck up
I’m not waking you up when you’re actually sleeping
That shit only happens like twice a year
But I want you to
So you can what
Tucker snap
Hold my hand
There’s no reason that Wash should feel hurt by those words but the feeling is there nonetheless
I just know what it’s like to wake up from a bad nightmare he says stiffly
There’s no reason for you to do the same when I’m six feet away
Oh please
Like you’d ever wake me up
Besides it doesn’t fucking matter
You’re not gonna be six feet away much longer Tucker says his voice still aggressive and harsh
Aren’t you supposed to be getting out of here
I can stay if you want Wash says before he can stop himself and Tucker snorts
I don’t need you to stay
I don’t want you to stay
Tucker Epsilon says sharply but Wash is already up and moving towards the door
Epsilon he says If Captain Tucker crashes will you come find me
I’ll raise the alarm dude
Great he says and exits without a second look at Tucker
Wash Wash ignores Tucker’s call
He hears Epsilon snap Nice going asshole before the door slams shut behind him
He’s halfway down the hall before he realizes that he has no clue where his armor actually is
Dr Grey’s office is just a few doors down he remembers from his wanderings yesterday so he storms in there first
Dr Grey is seated at her desk armored from the waist down
Why good morning Agent Washington she says sweetly
Did you get the all-clear from some other doctor to go wandering the halls
I wasn’t wandering the halls Wash says annoyed
I was just walking to your office
You said I could go yesterday remember
I said you could go after a final checkup
Did you have one of those
No but
Well then let’s scurry on back to your room and
I don’t want to go back to my room he says and sighs when she lifts an eyebrow
Look can we justdo it in here
Hmmmm she says but she grabs her medical scanner and waits for him to lift his shirt
Trouble in paradise
What does that mean
Well what it means is twenty-four hours ago I could barely drag you away from Captain Tucker and now you’re chomping at the bit to leave
Wash ignores that in favor of a more pressing issue
Can I just have my armor back now
Please
Dr Grey sighs
I suppose
She turns and opens a closet behind her revealing Wash’s steel and yellow armor
It’s hung up neatly and he feels a wave of affection for Dr Grey and the careful way she has stored his armor
Thanks he says and waits expectantly for her to leave
Should Ijust put my undersuit on in here or Whatever you like she mutters already re-absorbed in her computer
Wash sighs and puts on his Kevlar undersuit and armor as fast as possible reflecting dully that this is in fact the first time he’s gotten naked in front of someone in years
I do believe there’s a meeting going on that you’re supposed to be attending she chirps once he’s blessedly inside his armor once more
He pauses in the middle of checking the stock on his rifle
What meeting
Where
With whom
She shrugs not even looking up from her screens
I’m not sure
It sounded super important though
WhatDr Grey
Do you at least know what time this supposed meeting is
Hmmm
Forget it Wash says exasperated and turns to leave
He opens up the messaging interface on his HUD and fires off a text to Carolina
Do you know anything about this meeting I’m supposed to be attending
It’s only a few seconds before she responds
CL
Yes
Meet me in the SW corridor
WSH
I don’t even know where that IS
CL
Take two lefts a straight and a right out of the infirmary
Wash can’t see any other options so he begins his trek through the halls
He still doesn’t feel completely comfortable surrounded by so many strangers (so many armed strangers) but he’s far less anxious now that he’s back in his armor
He’s so wound up that it takes him a while to notice what’s so odd about his walk to this meeting
At first he thinks it’s his imagination but when a pair of cadets stops dead in their tracks as he walks by he realizes
Everyone is staring at him
Really staring
Stop-in-your-tracks staring
Shamelessly
And he can’t quite feel certain given they’re probably doing it over their radios but whispering
This had happened yesterday too and it’d made him so paranoid that he’d gone to extensive lengths to avoid interacting with anyone all day
He hadn’t exactly been quiet when he’d shouted at Tucker that he didn’t give a damn about the planet and he wonders just how many people heard him
Yesterday he’d thought that they were glaring at him mistrustfully but today he isn’t so sure
No one has come up to confront him for one thing and for another he’s pretty sure one of them just took a photograph of him on their datapad
When a group of New Republic cadets literally start walking backwards to get a better look at him Wash decides he can no longer ignore the situation
Can I help you
The four of them jump in unison exchanging a series of glances and shoves
You’re Agent Washington one of them finally pipes up and Wash is instantly distracted by the fact that the cadet sounds about thirteen
I
 yes
I am
I am Agent Washington
Wow one of them breathes reverently
She’s definitely young
He tries to think of the Lieutenants who had come to their rescue after the radio tower but between his concern for Tucker and his own looming unconsciousness he has only hazy memories of the Pelican ride back
Tucker’s Lieutenant the one who’d shoved him out of the way had been young but He glances around at the hallway full of cadets who have dropped all sense of pretense of urgency
This must be the New Republic wing of the base since he doesn’t see a single Federalist soldier in sight
Wash feels the sudden urge to give a motivational speech they’re staring at him so expectantly but he’s spared when Carolina comes stalking around the corner
The hallway mysteriously clears and Wash finds himself both impressed and exasperated that Carolina has clearly managed to establish a reputation so soon
He’s got some catching up to do
There you are
Sorry I gotheldup he trails off as they round the corner and almost mow down another pair of cadets who are gazing in awe at them
Carolina
Why are they all staring at us
Because we’re us Wash
He rolls his eyes
They call him dramatic
Okay
We’re Freelancers
How could they possibly all know that already
I’m getting the impression that gossip spreads quickly around here she says dryly
Okay but Don’t be daft Wash she says
The Federalists are already enamored with you from your time with them and to hear the New Republic soldiers tell it Tucker spent half his time here talking up your training and the other half pining after you
Wash is glad he has his helmet on
What that’s not no one was pining
I don’t
Sounds like there was a lot of pining going on
On both ends
What we were all worried
That tends to happen when you spend months thinking your team is being tortured by the enemy
Is that what you call crashing a tunnel of rocks down to ensure that they got out safely
Being worried
He pauses
You know about that
Freckles
Shake she says solemnly but this time Wash hears the note of teasing in her voice
It’s the stuff of legends around here
Very funny boss
The corridor they enter next is finally empty and Carolina pauses to pull him close lowering her voice despite the fact that they’ve been talking over the radio
Listen
Kimball and Doyledon’t exactly get along well
They’re having a hard time agreeing about what to do next
And why are the four of us having a meeting exactly
They want our help strategizing and setting up a training regimen
They want everyone training together
The only thing they agree on is the fact that the Reds and Blues are their best shot of bringing everyone together
They’ve spent time with both sides so no one will feel shunted
She sighs
This isn’t Freelancer Wash
These soldiers are in desperate need of some training and order
Wash gestures at the door with a growing sense of trepidation
Well let’s go in and see what we can do
The moment Carolina pushes open the door Wash wants to turn around and walk right back out
The room is simple and sleek with several monitors lining the walls
There’s a long table down the center of the room at which Wash assumes the esteemed leaders of the Federalist and New Republic armies should be seated conducting civilized negotiations
However the civilized negotiations look more like fierce debates and Kimball and Doyle are both out of their seats yelling across the table at each other
There are two soldiers from each side in the room as well to protect their leaders should the occasion arise Wash assumes
He wonders what they would do should an occasion actually arise given that the four of them are so engrossed at shouting at each other as well
Carolina clears her throat
There’s no way that all of them could have heard such an innocuous sound but everyone in the room falls silent at once
Wash straightens up and tries to look as if he hasn’t just spent two weeks in a hospital bed after getting his ass kicked by one of their biggest enemies
Doyle is the first to bound over to them shaking their hands vigorously
Agents Washington and Carolina he says as if announcing the king and queen of the galaxy
It is an honor
The Federal Army of Chorus could not be more grateful to have the two of you on our side
Rumors of your fighting prowess and esteemed
We’ve met Doyle Wash says exasperated but Doyle just continues to wring his hand quite the mind for strategy Agent Carolina or so the stories go and if I have heard correctly
Wash grins as a message pops up on his HUD
CL
Is he always like this
WSH
Oh just wait
You know the one who Wash presumes to be General Kimball says loudly they aren’t just here to help the Federal Army of Chorus Doyle
The New Republic could use a hand as well given that you’ve thoroughly decimated our supplies over the years
My dear Vanessa Doyle says patiently
Of course the
If you call me that one more time I swear to god I’m going to put a knife straight through that ridiculous helmet
Threats of assassination
Death
Bodily harm one of Doyle’s bodyguards howls and he actually takes several ominous steps towards Kimball
Carolina doesn’t do anything more than take two steps to the left positioning herself in between the Fed and Kimball but the soldier scrambles backwards so severely that he stumbles to the ground
Remarkable Doyle whispers staring in awe at the looming figure of Carolina then frowns at the soldier on the ground
On your feet Rodriguez
Wash rubs a hand over his visor before extending it to shake Kimball’s hand
General Kimball I take it
Agent Washington she says giving his hand a firm shake
He recognizes the tense curve of her shoulders all too well but there’s something rigid and unyielding there as well something unbreakable
We are very grateful that you and Agent Carolina have agreed to help us
Of course he says
My men feel very strongly about protecting the people of this planet
She tilts her head at him appraisingly
And how do you feel Agent Washington
Wash can see he hasn’t fooled her one bit
I feel very strongly about protecting my men
Well then it appears we have a common goal
It appears so says Wash and he decides then and there that he likes her
It’s been a long time since he’s fought for anyone that had an interest in being honest with him
So how can I help
Kimball sighs
Our soldiers could use some training
Real training
They are very young and those in charge of the training now are just as young
Tucker Grif Simmons and Caboose have done wonders for morale and they have certainly made improvements in training butwe could really use a soldier of your caliber
I’ve never trained anyone before Wash admits feeling the best thing to do would be to remain honest
At least not in any sort of official sense
Captain Tucker says you taught him everything he knows
I Wash pauses
Did he
He did
Wonderful Doyle interrupts brightly
So it’s settled then
We will work out a schedule for Agent Washington to train the rebels and the Federal Army of Chorus and
Hang on Wash interrupts
There’s no separate training
It’s absolutely vital that we have mixed training sessions
Wait one of Kimball’s cadets says
We have to train with them she gestures with her rifle towards the Federalist soldiers sounding as if Wash has just sentenced her to the gallows
Together
You have a common enemy now Carolina says sharply and the soldier melts back into the shadows with the tiniest of huffs
There isn’t any time for these silly games
Of course we will be asking the both of you to run missions for us Doyle says
We don’t want your considerable talents to go to waste
But in the meantime we would very much appreciate your help with these tasks
What can I do
Carolina asks
Well Kimball says slowly
We’ve got a lot of intel to run
You see we’rewe’re low very low on ammo
Without the mercenaries bringing in equipment Doyle says delicately
Our situation is indeed rather dire
And since someone didn’t think to ration our ammo Kimball says loudly our numbers aren’t going to hold up for very long
Well Miss Kimball perhaps we could have rationed our ammunition a trifle better if we weren’t defending ourselves from attacks every other day
We had to go on the offensive if we wanted to stay alive out there
So you’d like me to run recon Carolina says loudly
To seek out some ammunition stockpiles the mercs might have
Kimball throws a distracted glance her way
Yes exactly please she says before rounding on Doyle again
Come on Carolina says to Wash and the two of them slowly back their way out of the room
Well Wash says dully once he and Carolina are a safe distance down the hallway
At least that wasn’t a total waste of everyone’s time
Could’ve been worse
You should’ve been at their first meeting
At least we have some objectives now Carolina says with a sigh
Think you’re up to training this bunch Wash
Carolina I spent three months whipping Caboose and Tucker into shape
Trust me this
This is nothing
As if on cue Caboose comes bounding down the hallway towards them
Agent Washington he yells at what Wash is fairly certain is the top of his voice
You are awake
And walking
And in your armor
Before he can say anything Caboose picks him up and swings him around
His ribs protest this situation but Wash has learned the hard way that the more squirming one did in a Caboose hug the longer the hug went on
He sighs and ignores the flabbergasted helmeted stares of the soldiers scattered about the hallway
Hey Caboose
Caboose finally puts him down and holds him at arm’s length
Wash can’t see his face but he knows that Caboose is positively beaming
I like when you are out of your armor but I like when you are in it too
Wash files that one away for later inspection
How are you doing buddy
I am doing great
I was looking for you and then I found you
Oh wellyes yes you did Wash pauses
Wait why
Everything okay
Everything is great
It’s going to be better than great
I’m going to help you make lots of new friends
Alarm bells start sounding in Wash’s head
Uhwhy
Caboose sighs pityingly
Because everyone needs friends Wash
No I know I meant whywhy do you think you need to help me makefriends
Because Tucker says you’re really bad at it
Wash folds his arms
Oh really
And what else does Captain Tucker say
He says that you spent all yesterday hiding from people because you didn’t know how to make friends
Wash freezes
Impossible
There’s no way no way at all that Tucker could know he spent most of yesterday quietly cataloguing a corner of the armory
No way that he knew Wash felt uncomfortable and ridiculous and entirely out of place wandering the halls without his armor
This was something the Sim Troopers did find people and make homes out of them
He’s not cut out for this he knows it and he’d thought it best that he stay out of the way before
That’s ridiculous Wash says stiffly
I wasn’t hiding
Well Caboose says slowly
I couldn’t find you and I am very good at seeking so you must be very good at hiding
That’s when did Tucker tell you this anyway
I went to tell him what I had for breakfast this morning and he said oh my god Caboose I don’t care and Church said are you gonna make someone else cry today because then you’d be two for two and then Tucker said listen Caboose can you go find Wash and tell him to stop being such a GODDAMN BABY and maybe go talk to some people meet some chicks or dudes whatever he’s into 
Caboose’s ability to recall conversations word for word at breakneck speed is uncanny and Wash knows that if he doesn’t cut this off at the knees they’ll be here all day
Alright alright II get it
Wash Caboose says I am going to make you so many friends
And with that Caboose takes a hold of Wash’s wrist and starts dragging him down the hallway
Wash casts a pleading look over his shoulder at Carolina but she’s already shaking with laughter
Resigned he quickens his step so that he’s walking next to Caboose as opposed to being dragged behind him hoping this will be Caboose’s cue to let go of his wrist
Caboose does but only so that he can link his elbow through Wash’s and continue practically skipping down the hall
The low buzz of voices falters as they round the corner and Caboose finally stops
Wash fights the urge to run at breakneck speed as every helmeted face turns towards them
He has a moment to think oh no before Caboose sucks in a breath
MAY I HAVE YOUR ATTENTION PLEASE
Caboose
Wash hisses but it’s too late
I would like you introduce you all to Agent Washington
He is one of my very best friends
He is very good at being a best friend and everyone deserves to have lots of best friends
At the end of the hallway he catches a familiar flash of orange and maroon in his vision and isn’t surprised to see Grif and Simmons falling all over each other in silent laughter
Wash decides then and there that once training starts those two will be demonstrating all of the exercises for them and he likes cats and he puts too much sugar in his coffee and his armor used to be blue and he is still on Blue Team even though his armor is grey again and Blue Team is the best team and you can’t see but he has a lot of freckles which
Caboose pauses
Wash
Show them your freckles
Good god
He’s spared answering when a soldier with blue stripes down his armor steps up and offers him a formal salute
Agent Washington
It is an honor
The man is almost as tall as Caboose and his calm soothing voice sounds vaguely familiar
Uhthank you
Uh at ease soldier he says when it becomes clear that the soldier has every intention of standing there all day
Agent Washington we are forever in your debt
To have soldiers such as yourself and Agent Carolina lending your considerable talents to help us take back our planet is truly a deed beyond words
You were on the Pelican Wash realizes suddenly
There can’t possibly be two voices like that in this army
After the radio tower
LieutenantAndersmith
Andersmith’s voice actually chokes up a little
I am overwhelmed sir
Lieutenant Andersmith at your service
Andersmith is one of my best friends Caboose says brightly and the Lieutenant nods solemnly
I am truly touched to be given such a title
Not only is Captain Caboose the wisest leader I have ever followed into battle but he is also a compassionate caring friend
Caboose flings himself on Andersmith in a gigantic bear hug at those words who returns the hug with equal fervor
That coupled with the fact that Andersmith sounds so serious that he has to be genuine Wash decides that this one is alright
Well it’s a pleasure to meet you Lieutenant
I uh hope to see you in training soon
Andersmith straightens again
Youwill be training us sir
That’s the plan
The Lieutenant seems temporarily unable to speak
He finally manages An honor sir
May Ibe dismissed
To spread the news
Of courseDismissed soldier
With another snappy salute Andersmith takes off down the hall
Caboose yanks Wash around so fast that he’s convinced he just got whiplash but he follows a little more willingly now
It isn’t so bad Wash has to admit several hours later after Caboose has introduced him seemingly to every single New Republic soldier in the capital
The cadets stutter and stare and even bolt when Caboose first introduces them but seem to collectively grow bolder as the day goes on
They already all seem to know that Wash is to be in charge of their training and cluster around him in little groups to pepper him with questions
Agent Washington are you gonna teach us how to fight
Do we have to train with the Feds
Is it true that you were the best shot in Freelancer
I heard that he can hit a bull’s eyes without even looking at the target
That’s ridiculous
If he’s such a good shot then why did he get himself captured
Because he sacrificed himself haven’t you heard
Scarified himself
Oh my god wait so you haven’t heard the Freckles shake story
No Okay so you have to ask Kennedy he was actually there but he says like it was all tense and dramatic and he was wounded and then he looked right at Captain Tucker and he said right at him Kennedy says it was like something out of a movie collapsed the whole wall and
Kennedy says it was the most romantic thing he’s ever seen
Alright Wash says loudly
The group of cadets has grown since the start of their conversation seeming to magically suck more soldiers towards them as the topic turned to gossip
They all fall silent at once as turning to stare up at him
Wash opens and closes his mouth several times staring at the last soldier who spoke
Kennedy says it was the most romantic thing he’s ever seen before clearing his throat face hot beneath his helmet
Training will begin soon he says uselessly and they all scatter cheerfully breaking off in little groups
He spends the rest of the day with Caboose wandering around the base
Caboose shows him his room
Right next to mine and right next to Tucker’s because we needed a Blue Team hallway- and drags him into the mess hall to eat
The day winds down and before Caboose heads into his room for the night he removes his helmet and turns to look at Wash
See Wash
Now you have lots of friends
Uhyeah
Wash wonders if it’s really that simple but he remembers the way everyone rushed over to talk to Caboose and shake his hand or give him a hug
Maybe for some people it is
Thanks Caboose
Caboose frowns at him
But you are still sad
I’m not
Wash protests
I’m not
I enjoyedmaking new friends today
Really I did Caboose
Thank you
Caboose still looks confused but shrugs a little and turns into his room
Tell Tucker I said goodnight
And Church that I said goodnight
And that for dinner I had meatloaf with broccoli or as Tucker would call it mystery meat with
I’m not going to see Tucker Wash interrupts before he can really pick up steam
I don’t have to go back to the infirmary remember
All clear
I know that Agent Washington Caboose says and he actually rolls his eyes
But you are still going to see Tucker
Why do you want me to go see Tucker
I don’t want you to see Tucker
Wash considers himself to be pretty adept and interpreting what Caboose says but he is at a total loss
But
You want to see Tucker Caboose continues exasperated
Because you had a long day and you are feeling stressed out and dramatic
People can’t feel dramatic Caboose and when you are feeling stressed out and dramatic Tucker makes you feel

Feel
Caboose shrugs
Better
Wash stands outside the infirmary door for nearly a minute feeling equal parts annoyed and nervous for no discernable reason
Kennedy says it was the most romantic thing he’s ever seen
He gives himself a shake and shoves the infirmary door open leaning against the doorframe
Tucker glances up from his datapad and instantly tosses it aside when he sees Wash
How are you feeling
Wash asks stiffly
Tucker rolls his eyes when Wash remains standing where he is
Dude just get in the room
I didn’t mean to be a dick earlier
I’m just so tired of being in this fucking bed and
You’re not the only one Epsilon mutters
Wash sighs and inches forward a bit
It’s fine Tucker
Really I should be far more annoyed at how you got Caboose to introduce me to half the base
Oh shit he actually did that
He sure did
All day Wash emphasizes
Tucker is unsympathetic
Gotta meet some people sometime
It was a little more than some people Wash grumbles but he sits down on the bed across from Tucker
How did you know that Iyesterday That you spent all day avoiding people like the flood
Wash
Please
You were in need of some serious help on this one
And Caboose They love him Wash says
Caboose
Oh geez I know Tucker sighs
It’s like a fucking Caboose fan club around here
You have quite the fan club yourself Wash points out
Tucker puffs himself up a little
That’s ‘cause I’m a war hero Wash
People are lining up to suck my dick
Moving on Epsilon says hastily
Tucker for the love of god
Wash finds the predictable turn of Tucker’s mind comforting in a way he doesn’t examine too closely
He scoots up the bed leaning back against the wall and lets the sound of Epsilon and Tucker’s bickering soothe his harried nerves
This
 this is good
By the time Wash makes it back to his own bunk the base is dark and quiet
He is only slightly surprised when sleep continues to elude him he’d thought that at least being out of the hospital would help him to grab a few hours each night
His tiny room is small and foreign but there is a window at least
Midway through the night he rearranges his sheets so that the window lies at the foot of his bed as opposed to his head and looking at the starlight he finally falls into a dreamless sleep
About ten million years later Tucker is finally allowed out of the infirmary
He bounces his leg impatiently against the bed as Dr Grey finished her final exam throwing out the occasional yeah and uh-huh as she lectures him on the importance of taking it easy
The snap-hiss of his armor sealing has never sounded so good and he executes a few perfect swish-swish-stabs with his sword in the hallway and it’s amazing right up until the moment when Carolina rounds the corner
Don’t know what I have to do to get through to you people she’s still saying five minutes later although her voice has thankfully dropped a few octaves
Why you find it so hard to take anything seriously you are going to land yourself right back in the infirmary in no time if you keep carrying on like this
Oh-ho my god Carolina please stop I get it
He glances around the hallway and drops his voice
Can you maybe stop screaming at me
I have a reputation to keep up
You’re gonna embarrass me Jesus
Carolina’s helmet jerks back a little and when she apologizes the words actually sound sincere
I’m sorry Captain
You’re right
Tucker puffs out his chest
Fuck yeah I am
Feel free to call me Captain whenever you like
When I reprimand you I’ll be sure to do it when it’s just the two of us she says sweetly and Tucker deflates a little before brightening again
I mean if that’s what you’re into
And since you clearly feel up to swinging that sword around she says loudly You should be ready to start training soon
Well nowlet’s not get hasty That’s what I thought she says
Unfortunately I think we need to wait another week before you start any actual physical activity
Oh come ooon Tucker groans
Do you know how goddamn hard I worked to have this bod
It’s gonna wither away if I don’t do something soon
I thought you didn’t want to start training
I don’t butI also do
Epsilon projects his avatar casting a desperate look at Carolina
Do you see what I’ve been putting up with
Yeah yeah vacation’s over asshole Tucker says reaching up to his implants before realizing that Epsilon doesn’t actually have a chip
He gestures towards Carolina instead
Go on
Epsilon shifts uncomfortably
Well uhas desperate as I am to get out of the cesspool that you call your mind He trails off awkward and Tucker follows his line of thought
Church you don’t have to say he says exasperated
Seriously I’m fine
Apparently I do have to stay if the first thing you’re gonna do once you’re released from the infirmary is bust out some half-assed katas in the hallway he mutters
I’ll just
Hang out for a few days make sure you’re in the clear and then I’ll be on my way
Carolina tilts her head at him appraisingly and it takes Tucker a moment to realize that she looks proud
I think that’s a great idea Epsilon
Tucker could use an extra pair of eyes for a few more days
Uh I’m not a charity case
It’s not like I wanna stay Epsilon says and Tucker rolls his eyes
Classic Church Sulk
I just like have to
For his own stupid good
Tucker tries to hide the pleased feeling that comes with these words but then gives it up
You care about me he crows to Epsilon who starts sputtering
You do
You think I’m your best
Friend
Carolina claps her hand on Tucker’s shoulder
Well I’ll just leave you boys to it then she says brightly
Epsilon if he does anything reckless
I want to know all about it
Well she’s clearly taking advantage of alone time Tucker says as Carolina saunters off down the hallway
Wanna take bets on who she’s banging
No Tucker I do not want to take bets on who she’s banging
Tucker grins as Epsilon huffs and starts down the unfamiliar halls
He has to admit he can see how this would’ve freaked Wash out wandering around without his armor
Nearly everyone he passes is in full or at least partial armor and the Federalists all do a double take
Tucker isn’t convinced he wouldn’t have spent half the day hiding in the armory either
Speaking of which
So like Wash Tucker starts but Epsilon cuts him off with a groan
Oh God please don’t start this again
I can’t take it
I really can’t
Tucker huffs
Well help me figure it out then
Tucker I promise you that this is literally the last thing in the entire world that I want to talk about
I thought of him Tucker says again because this is important he just knows it
If only he knew how or why
I thought of Junior which is obvious and that time it rained in Blood Gulch which was I don’t know I guess it was cool or whatever
But why would I think of Wash
Like Wash specifically
I really have no idea
C’mon he says pleadingly
You’re in my head can’t you tell me what I’m thinking
Tucker maybe this is something you should be figuring out for yourself
Oh please Tucker grumps
Don’t pretend you’re that deep
You just don’t wanna talk about it
Bingo
Tucker frowns thinking hard
He does remember the moment with astounding clarity
It had been just him and Wash at the crash site
Wash had been attempting to teach him something about gun disarming but they’d kept getting distracted by the Reds bickering across the way
Sarge was supposed to be conducting his own training session and for some reason Wash was more concerned about getting them to stop screwing around than whatever he was supposed to be teaching Tucker
He’d been so serious brows furrowed and shoulders tense until Tucker had gotten fed up and done a truly world-class impersonation of Wash
And Wash instead of being angry instead of ordering him to do a thousand push-ups had thrown back his head and laughed
The mood of their training session had shifted after that
Wash loosened up and Tucker stopped whining and it allowed something light and easy to settle between them
It wasn’t so bad he had to admit the whole training thing
Seeing some of the tension in Wash’s shoulder lift after that laugh had left Tucker feeling pretty pleased with himself
Wash had just looked so relaxed laughing in the sun and there’d been something about it something I gotta recreate that moment he says finally
With Wash at the crash site
Maybe then I can figure out what was so goddamn special about it
And just how do you plan to do that
I just need to see him standing in the light or some shit fuck I don’t know
How hard could it be
Tucker had forgotten how much Wash hated being out of armor
He’d seen Wash fairly often without his armor in the days following Sidewinder first because he was injured and then because he just didn’t care about the consequences
Tucker hadn’t put this together until Carolina had shown up at which point Wash barely took his helmet off let alone all of his armor
It had taken ages before Wash finally took his armor off for more than two seconds at the crash site and once Felix had arrived and Wash had painted his armor back to steel it was game over
Getting Wash to remove his helmet here on a military base filled with people he doesn’t trust was going to be nearly impossible let alone the rest of his armor
Well Tucker thinks nothing wrong with a challenge
He hardly sees Wash his first day back
Tucker spends his time swaggering around the base high-fiving all the New Republic soldiers and showing up just in time to interrupt Palamo who is smack in the middle of what sounds like an extremely well-rehearsed story of how he apparently thought the evac at the crash site went down
At lunchtime Tucker drops his tray smack into the middle of a table full of Feds and elbows his way between two of them
They are stiff and unresponsive at first but thirty minutes later he and Church have them all howling with laughter aaaand Tucker notes in satisfaction half the mess hall is looking their way
Some of them look confused and rather mutinous but many of the soldiers keep glancing over curiously
His meeting with Kimball and Doyle is far less amusing
Simmons finds him halfway through the day and chastises him for being late to what is apparently A Super Important and Super-Secret Captains Meeting and hurry up Tucker we’re going to get in trouble didn’t Caboose tell you about this meeting
Of course Caboose didn’t tell me
Tucker cries struggling to keep up as Simmons pelts hell-mell down the hallway
He barely remembers his own name some days what the hell makes you think he remembered to tell me about a meeting
I don’t know Tucker do you think I have time to fix another one of your Blue Team Problems
Why did you say it like that
Like it’s a thing
Because it is a thing
And why couldn’t one of you have radioed me anyway
Or sent a text
Why did you have to come charging through the base like a bat out of hell
He sighs when Simmons doesn’t answer
Didn’t even occur to you
Did it
Oh look we’re here says Simmons and he comes to an abrupt halt in front of the door
He inches his way through and throws up a salute so enthusiastically that his armored hand bounces off his visor
Generals
Captain Simmons reporting for duty
I have brought Captain Tucker
Yes thank you Simmons Kimball mutters distractedly
Although I did just mean you could send him a message
"Tucker this is General Donald Doyle
Doyle Captain Tucker
Pleased to meet you Captain Tucker Doyle says and sticks out his hand
What’s up Tucker says by way of greeting
Captain Tucker allow me to introduce you to my Captains
We have more of course but these are the four that you will be working most closely with
Captains Fitz Perry Ali and Patil at your service
Tucker glances surreptitiously over at Doyle’s four Captains who are standing at rigid attention in a formation so intense that Tucker is half-convinced they’re about to break out into a dance routine and tries to imagine what they think of Kimball’s Captains
Between Grif lounging in what’s clearly supposed to be Kimball’s chair with his feet on the meeting table Caboose standing on said table unscrewing a perfectly good lightbulb Simmons still standing at the door with a salute thrown up and Tucker well Tucker thinks he looks relatively normal he wouldn’t be surprised if Kimball threw them all out and started from scratch
But Kimball barely seems to notice the fact that Grif is half asleep or that Caboose is swapping out two lightbulbs for no discernible reason
She is straight backed and proud dripping confidence and when she speaks to Doyle it’s with a ringing pride that makes Tucker suddenly feel affectionate for her
I assure you my Captains will do whatever it takes to ensure the safety of this planet and the integration our two armies she’s saying
Miss Kimball I have no doubts that they will try Doyle says delicately
Tucker rolls his eyes
Hey I was doing a great job just now
Church and I just made friends with a whole bunch of Feds
I didn’t see any of the Chorus dance squad over there trying to mingle in the mess hall
Church materializes just long enough to air high-five Tucker before vanishing again and Kimball shakes her head a little
Why is this even a thing
Grif says apparently waking up out of a dead sleep to add his two cents to the conversation
Fucking Red Team
Like this whole integration bullshit
Not that I really care or anything but didn’t you both just find out you’ve been getting fucked over for the last several years
There is a bigger bad guy to fight Caboose says and having finished switching the lightbulbs he moves to rearranging the chairs
Very big
With big ships and guns
You are all small with small ships and small guns but if you put the small things together they too will make a big thing
One of Doyle’s Captains clears his throat
Permission to speak sir
Ahyes go ahead Fitz
I agree with Captain Boxcar
There is too much at stake and it is vital to the survival of this great planet that we work together too
Wait Grif interrupts
Did you just call him Captain Boxcar
Er Because I mean there’s no way you could’ve possibly misheard that
I’msorry I meant Captain Caboose Caboose and Tucker say at the same time
Yes
CaptainCaboose
He makes a good point
Thank you Fitz says Doyle
Let me assure you I am by no means disagreeing
Because Caboose and Boxcar sound nothing alike
Did you really just pick another train name and hope for the best
Or was that supposed to be funny
Grif Kimball says through gritted teeth we get it thank you
Tucker sighs
What were we even talking about here
There’s a moment of silence as everybody visibly tries to remember the original point of the conversation
Literally nothing Church says blinking into life again
We didn’t make it past introductions before Grif here decided to derail the whole process
Ha
Get it
Derail
Like a trainlike He trails off and glances around at them all then vanishes with a sigh
Okay great Tucker says we’re your Captains these are Doyle’s Captains we’re all gonna set a good example for the kids and try to get along
Anything else
Weapons Church says appearing for the third time
The weapons shortage
It’s shitty
If you’re gonna keep interrupting why don’t you just stay out here
Permission to speak barks Ali
Or maybe Perry
Tucker can’t remember which
Permission granted Ali
We were not told that the New Republic had an AI as part of their assets
Such a tactical advantage could change everything
That’s because the New Republic doesn’t have an AI
Tucker says
Church is normally with Carolina and he’ll be going back to her soon enough
So
 his chip can be passed around
He doesn’t have a chip Simmons says finally dropping his salute
Church has the ability to jump from host to host
He travels via neural implants which we all have since we were part of Project Freelancer
Since you were Simulation Troopers in Project Freelancer says Ali
Dude Grif says You realize we’re not from Chorus right
And that we’re not the people you’ve been fighting for years now
And that we don’t actually give a shit about this civil war you’ve all been wrapped up in since there are way bigger problems that we now have to deal with
So maybe take your hostility down a notch Tucker adds
So the weapons shortage Kimball says loudly
It’s a problem
We’ve taken inventory and we’re going to have to be very careful not to waste any
Agent Carolina will be in charge of finding new weapon stockpiles but what we need from you all is to make sure that none of the ammunition we do have is wasted
Target practice is to be done sparingly
We have to make every shot on the field count
Tucker takes a seat as the two of them launch into detail how the Federalist weapons depots are all but out of their reach seeing as how they are bound to be heavily guarded by Felix and Locus
That’s fine Tucker says darkly
I’m looking forward to a rematch
Yes well Doyle says I think it best to avoid engaging the mercenaries unless absolutely necessary
I still think that’s a terrible idea says Kimball
We need to hit them and hit them hard
It’s the last thing they’ll be expecting this early in the game
If we can remove Felix and Locus from the equation even just one of them it will be a huge victory for us
Sign me up for that mission Tucker says
I mean I totally agree
Cut off the head of the snake and all that shit
You just want a chance to fight Felix again Simmons finally pipes up from the corner
The point Kimball interrupts before Tucker can even think to snap back Is that we will be going on missions to retrieve the ammunition soon enough
For now your objectives are twofold focus on conserving the ammo we do have and focus on your training
We have placed Agent Washington in charge of training so it’s important that you all set a good example and help him where you can
Agent Washington is a highly capable soldier Doyle all but gushes
He has made quite a difference in our soldiers’ skill sets in a fairly short amount of time
For some reason Tucker feels as smug as if Doyle’s just complimented him at these words
Uh so does that mean we aren’t training our cadets anymore
On the contrary Doyle says You will all be training together
Wash is going to oversee all of the training but it’ll be up to him to set training schedules and
Wait Tucker interrupts
Wait
So Wash is going to be training us too
That’s what just said yes
But I already have to do private lessons with Wash
Can’t I skip these
Tucker Kimball says sternly
Agent Washington is going to be setting the training schedules
We are still working out all the kinks
So again I need you all to set a good example
Is that clear
She glances around the room until all of the Captains make various signs of assent
Yeah yeah I got it Tucker mutters when her gaze falls on him and takes a moment to reflect on the fact that he’s apparently going to be doing nothing but training for the rest of his life
Well Tucker says to Epsilon with a sigh as they exit down another hallway at least I’ll get some more opportunities to figure this whole Wash thing out
Or conversely Epsilon says There could just not be a whole ‘Wash thing’ and then nobody has to watch this inevitable train wreck
Haha He finally sees Wash that evening outside their quarters
He’s leaning against the wall tapping away on his datapad but glances up when Tucker rounds the corner
How was your first day back
Tucker considers
Well I didn’t bleed out all over the base like you were so worried about so I’d call that a win
That’s not funny Tucker Wash says and his voice is so quiet that Tucker actually feels a little guilty
Sorry sorry
He pauses
I did make some new Fed friends though
I saw Wash says his voice brightening
In the mess hall
That’s great
Yeah well
Kimball does want us to help you set a good example
Speaking of that I was hoping for your assistance in setting up a training schedule
I’d like to know what you have been teaching the soldiers so that I can use that as a baseline
Sure
Wash lowers the datapad staring at him
Wait really
Uh yeah
Oh wellthanks Tucker
Dude says Tucker irritated I’ve been training these guys for months
I want them to be good too
I know that Wash says quickly
I just thought you’d be happy to be relieved of the burden
It’s fine
I’ve been sitting on my ass for so long that I’m dying to do something
Alright then
Wash turns off his datapad with a shrug
I’ll see you bright and early tomorrow
Zero six hundred
Yeah yeah wait what time
Wash starts pounding on his door at zero six hundred on the dot the next morning and it’s out of sheer habit that Tucker takes his good old time about it
By the time he gets his armor on and emerges from his room Wash has already worked himself up into lecture mode
Captain Tucker
When I tell you that I need you up by zero six hundred I mean that I need you fully armored and ready to go
Not rolling out of bed
Not getting dressed
Fully armored and ready to go
Is that understood
Understood says Tucker but his yawn makes the words come out more like unnnnahhhhoooooo
Wash is not amused but he starts leading the charge to the mess hall
The scrambled eggs and toast they’re serving isn’t the greatest but at least there’s coffee and Tucker’s halfway through chugging his second cup before he notices Wash glaring at his own paper coffee cup as if it’s personally offended him
There’s a sugar shortage he explains when he notices Tucker staring
The coffee is so bitter here
He takes another unenthusiastic sip and Tucker finds himself working hard to keep from grinning
Wash looks so human in that moment all messy-haired and cranky because he can’t dump ten tablespoons of sugar into his coffee
Tucker makes a mental note to keep an eye out for some sugar if they end up doing supply runs not that Wash really needs anymore sugar in his diet
Yeah well you use too much sugar anyway he says and Wash pouts
Actually pouts
His nose scrunches up and his mouth turns down at the corners and it’s so goddamn cute that Tucker wants to grab his stupid freckly face and
His thoughts come to a screeching halt as he sits up in alarm
Jesus Christ what’s gotten into him
Whatever it is it needs to stop Epsilon mutters crankily and Tucker gives himself a little shake
Right
He needs to focus
He needs to prioritize
Set his goals straight keep the armies alive
Keep the Feds and News from killing each other
Kill the mercs
And find out why Wash was the last thing he thought of before almost dying
Tucker
Are you listening to me
Tucker straightens up to see Wash standing up at the table fitting his helmet back on
Huh
Oh yeah
Toooootally listening
Got every word
We doing this or what
Tucker spends half of their walk from the mess hall frantically trying to figure out where they’re going before he realizes that Wash is leading them towards the armory
He wants to take inventory of the weapons himself to see what they might use for training
Tucker is in the middle of regaling him with stories of training the cadets when they arrive
I mean if you think I’m bad wait until you have to train oh my god
Tucker stops so suddenly in the doorway that Wash stumbles into him
What
What’s wrong
Nothing Tucker says quickly
Nothing
Come on let’s go in
He pushes open the door and steps fully into the armory mind racing
Epsilon is following the lines of his thoughts until-- Oh geez
Tucker Shut up Tucker tells him distractedly
He’s making a beeline for the weapons testing range outside the armory the one that’s marked with caution tape
And offset with bright glowing red lights
Perfect
Uh Tucker
You were saying
Hmmm
Tucker mumbles
Oh
Uh
Training
Palomo
He’s annoying like really annoying so have fun with that
I’ve had my share of annoying Wash mutters then sighs loudly as he almost runs into Tucker again
Would you stop doing that
Tucker comes to a halt once they’re both bathed in the harsh red glow of the warning lights and turns to look at Wash
Now if only You have something on your helmet Tucker blurts
He can practically feel Epsilon face-palming inside his head
Wash’s brings a half-hearted hand up to his helmet
Where
Onthe side
Right there
Wash brushes a hand along the side of his helmet
Did I get it
No Well what is it
I don’t know
Here give it to me
What
Your helmet Tucker emphasizes
C’mon give it here I’ll get it off
Get what off
There’s a bug on it
Wash tuts impatiently
Tucker just brush it off
Idon’t like bugs Tucker improvises wildly
So like if you just give me your helmet I can Since when don’t you like bugs
Wash asks suspiciously
I’ve seen you get them out of Caboose’s room at least a dozen times
Goddammit
Well I don’t like these bugs
Tucker
Wash give me your goddamn helmet
Wash does
He’s shocked when Wash removes his helmet at Tucker’s words revealing a bewildered and slightly annoyed face
What’s gotten into you
Tucker stares at him for a beat too long trying to figure out why he feels so dazed before snapping back into action
One mystery at a time
Wash that bug is gonna get on you here
He snatches the helmet out of Wash’s hands and makes a big show out of shaking it dramatically and stomping the life out of the imaginary bug on the ground
There
Finally
Tucker glances at Wash standing in the glow and sighs in disappointment
The harsh red is illuminating his hair but it’s still not right
The glare of the sirens is too harsh unlike the soft glow of the sun that had lit Wash up at the crash site
There’s also the fact that Wash wasn’t staring at him as if he’d lost his mind at the crash site but Tucker thinks that’s beside the point
He’ll have to try something else
Epsilon groans in despair as Tucker hands the helmet back to Wash
All better he says cheerfully
Gotta watch thosethose bugs Wash
They’re poisonous
Tucker we are wearing power armor
Yeah butyou know what fine don’t thank me for saving your ungrateful ass from one of Chorus’s most lethal specimens
It’s the color Tucker decides
The color had been all wrong
Tucker I really really don’t think you’re on the right track here
Tucker ignores Epsilons’ desperate whisper as he watches Wash tape lines that are supposed to mean something all over the training room floor
The color had been all wrong in the armory
He needed something different something really and truly red
And for red he needed
TKR
I need ur help wash is taping up the layout in the training room and we could use your expertise The look of confusion on Wash’s face when Sarge sweeps theatrically into the training room five minutes later is worth it particularly when Sarge points a finger at Wash and howls Treachery
Wash pauses in the middle of cutting a pieces of tape off the role
Can Ihelp you Sarge
Help me
Sarge marches forward and snatches the tape out of Wash’s hands
I think you’re the one who needs help Blue
I don’t
Taping off the training sections huh
Sarge turns in a slow circle then points towards a particularly large taped square
That the hand to hand section
Yes and
And that
Sarge gestures again
That for knife work
Yes and
And I suppose strength training will be there
Yes and
It’s all wrong
All of it
We need to start from scratch
Which is when Sarge starts ripping the tape off the floor and Wash loses his patience completely and the two of them start a tug-o-war match over the duct tape
It’s entertaining sure but when Tucker turns his helmet lamp on to try to light Wash up against Sarge’s bright red armor all he gets is both Wash and Sarge yelling at him in annoyance and absolutely no warm feeling in his chest
I mean you didn’t actually expect that to work
Tucker glares at where Epsilon is seated glumly on the bench next to him before relenting
Okay no I didn’t butit’s pretty funny right
Yeah Epsilon says snickering as Wash tackles Sarge to the ground
Yeah it’s pretty funny
Over the course of the next two days Tucker manages to get Wash standing helmetless in front of a kitchen fire a weapons test explosion and a painted red wall and he’s accomplished nothing except spectacularly annoying Wash
He’s starting to think he imagined the whole thing the light the feeling in his chest
He’d even gotten Wash to laugh during the day well Grif had gotten Wash to laugh and Tucker had perked up thinking maybe that was it the laughing but as nice as it was that hadn’t done it either
At least they’d come up with a pretty solid training plan
He’d finally given up at the end of day two and sat down with Wash and Grif who was probably the least suited to coming up with a training regimen but was too lazy to get up and leave from where he and Wash had set up camp
He’d thrown out a few sarcastic comments that Wash had somehow managed to find value in and boom they had their training schedule
As a result Wash is in a relatively good mood so Tucker can’t call the day a total waste
He’s feeling sleepy and content when they finally head back to their quarters at the end of the day and
Tucker feels a jolt of excitement as they round a corner on their way the Blue Team hallway
There’s a window at the end of the hallway and it’s spilling in a glorious amount of dying sunlight
Okay Tucker he tells himself
Don’t fuck this up
Play it cool
He ambles casually down the hallway to lean against the windowsill
Wash joins him and for a few moments they stare out the window in companionable silence
It’s a nice looking planet Tucker says and as the words leave his mouth he realizes that they’re kind of true
Chorus is a planet of extremes icy planes and lush jungles
The alien spires dotting every horizon give it an otherworldly look and the skies are open and encompassing
He reaches up casually and removes his helmet propping it up against his hip
It’s a little hot Wash answers leaning his shoulder against the window frame
Don’t tell me you’re one of those people who likes cold weather better than hot
Wash laughs a little
I might be
You might be
He falters a little
I don’tI’m not sure really
Sometimes I like the heat and sometimes the cold
It’s hard toI can’t tell which isI mean There’s a stab of guilt inside his head from where Epsilon is listening quietly
I like the rain though Wash says finally
I know I like the rain
There’s something in those words that tells Tucker they are important very important but he isn’t sure why
The rain is nice he offers because he supposes he must like the rain too if he thought of it before he almost died
It never rained in the desert
Wash does a little shake of his head turning to look at Tucker
He does this sometimes Tucker’s noticed goes all quiet and thoughtful before pulling back slightly with his shoulders and giving his head a little shake
Tucker’s yet to figure out exactly what it means but he knows better than to ask Wash about it
Think we can do it
Save the planet and all that shit
Tucker asks trying to keep his voice light and casual as if this isn’t a question of vital importance
Wash sighs
I think we have a shot he says slowly
I think that if we can get these people to work together then we have a shot
Tucker feels something deep inside his chest go calm at these words but the next second he’s standing up straight again because Wash is finally finally reaching up to pop the seals on his own helmet
He stares out the window and there it is the right light the perfect light turning Wash’s hair to flame and his eyes to oceans
Tucker subtly inches backwards until he can get a clear look at Wash
He’s peering hard out the window eyebrows furrowed slightly
The sun is painting his hair a ruby red and illuminating every single one of his freckles
Tucker waits expectantly nerves tingling in anticipation but nothing happens
There’s no flutter in his chest no trip-trapping of his heart nothing to suggest that this should be the last thing he thinks of before dying
It’s nice Tucker thinks clinically but not really any different from looking at a work of art
Sure Wash has the kind of jawline one might expect to see on ancient statues and Tucker thinks it might be a respectable goal to lick every single one of those freckles but
Oh my god he breathes before he can stop himself
Wash turns to stare at him lifting an eyebrow and yep yep that is definitely doing it for him he is absolutely one hundred percent here for that eyebrow-raise-smirk thing Wash is doing
Tucker are you feeling okay
Dude I am feeling so okay Tucker says enthusiastically
I just uh
I have to go do a thing
But
Tucker takes off down the hallway leaving a bewildered Wash still standing in the window with the sunset caught in his hair like a fucking painting
He walks as fast as he can without actually running to Blue Team’s hallway and skids into his room slamming the door shut and leaning his back against it mind racing
I’m gonna fuck him he announces and once the words are out he can’t understand why it took them this long to say them
Dude
I am so gonna fuck him
Epsilon projects his avatar in front of Tucker’s face arms folded across his chest
Very funny Tucker
This is without a doubt the greatest idea I’ve ever had Tucker continues ignoring him
Why did it take me so long to think of this
He’s hot I’m hot there’s this whole like authority kink already in place
Oh my god
You’re serious
Aren’t you
I’m so serious dude
Tucker pauses
Wait
That’s an important question
Is he into dudes
I have no idea
What
Yes you do you were in his head c’mon you gotta help me out here
Epsilon stares at him
You’re joking right
Uhno
Are you did you see the look on his face when I let slip that I knew how many times he had his ribs broken
Well yeah
And you want me to tell you all about his sexual preferences
Tucker shifts guiltily
Wellit’s for a good cause
Jesus Christ
It is
Wash deserves to feel good
I’m gonna make him feel so good
Epsilon sighs
Is there any way I can talk you out of this
Nope
You uh might wanna log off now though
Why
Epsilon asks alarmed
You’re notyou’re not gonna try to put this half-assed plan into action now are you
Of course not Tucker says impatiently
This is a situation that requires finesse
I need all my best moves
Good because I really don’t want to have to witness this so if you can maybe wait until I’m back with Carolina
I am gonna go jerk off and think of Wash though ‘cause I need to see if that does it for me before I do anything else
So unless you wanna help me with that Epsilon vanishes logging off and sequestering himself somewhere deep inside Tucker’s head and Tucker wastes absolutely no time getting comfortable on his bunk and congratulating himself on what is surely the best idea he’s ever had
Wash isn’t planning to admit this to anyone out loud ever but staring around at the disaster that is his first training session with the New Republic cadets he has to conclude that Grif and Tucker were right
The two armies absolutely need separate training sessions to start
Trust me dude Tucker had said when Wash made a face at this proposition
I don’t know how legit these Feds are but if you throw them together with the News right away there’s gonna be a lot of tears and a lot of drama
Just give ‘em a few days to warm up to you and get used to like actual training Grif added
Wash had sighed
What do you call what you guys were doing with them
Fake training
Tucker and Grif had exchanged a glance
Uh compared to the hell you’re probably about to unleash
That’s exactly what we’d call it
Great Grif that’s very helpful
It had taken a bit more coaxing but eventually Wash had agreed to spend a week training the Feds and News separately before combining his efforts
He supposes it will be a good baseline
He supposes it can’t hurt to get to know the cadets a bit
He supposes
LEFT he screams as the cadets running the fake infiltration scenario promptly turn right I SAID to enter the building from the LEFT
He supposes they have a lot to learn
Stop stop everybody stop
Wash resists the urge to slap a hand over his visor and groan
Juststop
Team A come back over here
Team B reset
They’re going to try to infiltrate your base again
He waits until the cadets from Team A shuffle around him before casting his gaze around in despair
Britton
Why did you lead your squad through the right
Did we not just spend twenty minutes drilling an attack formation that originates from the left
Sir yes sir she barks puffing up her chest
Well then what happened
Sir I she casts a furtive gaze around at her friends before deflating
I forgot sir
You forgot yes
You realize that if this had been an actual military operation you would’ve just gotten your entire squad killed right
That I forgot is hardly an excuse you can bring home to your Commanding Officer
I’m sorry Agent Washington she mumbles head bowed
He sighs
Everyone back in your original positions
We’re trying this again
Got it Britton
You’re trying this again
I want to see better results this time
Wash folds his arms as the cadets scamper off to their positions to reset
The cluster of abandoned buildings inside the capital was the perfect place to drill real-life training scenarios although Wash is starting to wish he’d stuck to target practice
He hadn’t been expecting them to be good but thishe’s amazed and privately impressed that they’ve been able to hold their own against the Feds for this long
The Feds hadn’t been anything spectacular particularly not compared to the caliber of soldiers Wash was used to working with but they had been adequate
They were certainly disciplined enough to get through a training session without bickering or complaining or forgetting their left from their right
Wash is once again grateful for Tucker and Grif’s advice as he can’t imagine the disaster that would’ve ensued if he’d tried to train the two armies together right off the bat
He owes them big time
Wash winces as Team A infiltrates the fake base with no small amount of unnecessary commotion and Team B begins peppering them with fake paintball bullets from above
He’d had a second far calmer meeting with Kimball yesterday and she’d shown him just how low their ammo was
It’s vital that we don’t use it in training not even in target practice she’d explained
I know the fake bullets aren’t as accurate but if we run short I understand General he’d said and he’d hoped that his tone didn’t reveal the sickening way his stomach had swooped at seeing their startlingly low ammo supply
We can ration this butno matter how careful we are we’re going to need more
I know she said with a sigh
That’s why I’m making it Agent Carolina’s top priority to find us more
Once we know where to look we’ll work on retrieving it
Do they know he’d asked
Felix and Locus
Do they know how low we are
Felix
Kimball had spat the name 
Felix definitely knows
Doyle claims that Locus wasn’t ‘privy to the Federal army’s supply information’ but I’m not holding my breath
Wash snaps himself out of the unhappy memory as the cadets open fire on each other
USE THE SIGHT ON YOUR RIFLE
He hollers at one of the cadets on B Team
Martinez who has just emptied half the stock on his rifle with success whatsoever
I AM
Martinez wails
It’s these STUPID GUNS
I can’t do anything with them
FUCK this
He hurls the rifle aside launches himself out the window of the crumbling building and tackles one of the opposing cadets to the ground
Wash drags both hands down his visor as the two teams descend into an all-out brawl all thoughts of stealth and completing the mission forgotten
PRAJAPATI he bellows as one of the Team A cadets kicks one of the opposing teammates straight through a wall
PRAJAPATI YOU DO NOT RESORT TO HAND TO HAND IN A LIVE FIRE SITUATION UNLESS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY
He’s starting to wonder if there’s some issue with the audio receivers on the cadets’ helmets because her response is to slam her fist into the side of another fully-armed cadet’s helmet
Wash throws up his hands and storms into the fray hauling cadets off of each other and yelling until he’s hoarse
It isn’t until five minutes later when he catches a flash of white armor in the doorway that he realizes just how long their training session has run
EVERYONE STOP
Wash yells but it’s too late
It’s only then that he sees the fatal flaw in his carefully crafted training schedule booking the New Republic and Federalist training sessions back to back was probably not the best idea
He’d been assuming everyone would finish up on time
Of course he’d also been assuming that the cadets would know how to run a basic infiltration strategy but in hindsight he supposes that was expecting too much
Wash cringes as the group of Federalist soldiers he’s supposed to be training next come swaggering fully into the room positioning themselves at the edges of the training floor
Alright alright practice is over for today everyone off the floor he bellows at the cadets all of whom ignore him
God what a mess one of the Federalist soldiers mutters under his breath
Perry Wash remembers from his time in the Federalist compound
One of Doyle’s captains
Wash takes a moment to reflect in despair that the cadets who were all mysteriously deaf to his screaming in their ears thirty seconds prior mysteriously all pick up on a muttered whisper across the room
What did you just say one of the paint-splattered cadets
Prajapati who sends teammates flying through walls
I said you’re all a mess Perry responds then casts a despairing gaze towards Wash
Agent Washington I am so sorry that you have to train with these losers
Why you little
Alright alright Wash says loudly snagging two of the cadets by the arms as they storm forward
Captain Perry I want five laps around the perimeter
These soldiers are all your teammates now
I don’t want to hear another negative word about their training sessions is that understood
Understood Agent Washington Perry mutters
Ooooooh someone just got told Palomo snickers and Wash closes his eyes briefly and counts to five before letting go of the cadets
Dismissed he says exhausted and the cadets slump out of the room
I want to see everyone back at the same time tomorrow morning got it
I saw that Palomol
Losers one of the other Feds mutters and Wash rounds on him
Captain Ali
Was I not clear
You are all on the same team now
Negative comments towards your teammates will not be tolerated
Now I want ten laps around the perimeter from all of you and if I hear one more word about the New Republic soldiers it’ll be another ten for each smart remark
Understood
They take off without another word
His training session with the Feds is just as bad if not worse
He can’t understand it at first they were nowhere near this terrible in the compound but as the hours drag he realizes what’s so wrong
They’re overcompensating trying their best to show off and prove that they’re better than the New Republic soldiers
Wash watches in growing exasperation as their infiltration mission stretches on and on all of the Feds frozen in their individual hiding spots unwilling to make a sound
It’s not hide and seek he yells after five minutes of absolute stillness
Ali move your squad up
Ali does not in fact move his squad up
Ali and his squad spend another five minutes in dead silence communicating solely via a series of complex hand signals that Wash begins to suspect they spent at least an hour practicing prior to this disastrous practice
When Perry stands up and begins to add leg signal into the mix Wash throws up his hands grabs his training rifle and storms into structure
A mysterious soldier has just found his way into your ranks and you have no idea which side he’s on
He rounds the corner and fires a round of fake bullets at Perry who crumbles out of the ridiculous one-legged perch he’s currently standing in
Come on figure it out move it
Twenty laps two spark fires and one screaming match between the Captains later the soldiers are blessedly filing out of the training room
Wash stares blankly at the wall for several minutes he can’t remember the last time he felt this exhausted before sighing and beginning the trek to the indoor training facilities
Tucker’s first lesson is next and Wash thinks it might be good to get there a little early to set up
He realizes he has no idea what time it is and panics eyes flicking to the clock on his HUD but relaxes when he realizes he has a few minutes
He enters the empty training room and begins removing his armor his paint splattered armor he notes in dismay stacking it neatly on a bench
He’s spent a fair amount of time writing up what he thinks it will be beneficial for Tucker to learn and since he favors close-quarters combat Wash thinks starting with arteries and pressure points while outside of armor would be best before moving on to isolating these areas in armor
He’s just finished changing into sweats and a t-shirt when an indignant voice makes him jump
And just what do you think you’re doing buster
He whirls to see Donut looming in the doorway hands on his hips
Wash glances around the room blankly trying to see what he’s doing that’s so incriminating
I’mgetting ready for my next training session
Hmmmmppph Donut snorts
Hmmph
Skipping lunch
As I suspected
Oh Truth be told the thought to go grab food hadn’t even occurred to him until now
I’ll grab something after
You will not
Donut sweeps into the room
I know this game bud
You did this all the time when we were with the Feds and I for one am not going to stand for it
Donut
You’ve been training all morning and
How do you know I’ve been training all morning
Wash the training schedule isn’t a secret
Wash supposes not
Oh
Well that’s a fair point
Besides everyone’s been sneaking past all morning to get a look at how you’re faring with the Feds and News
We’re taking bets on how long it takes for them to play nice
Wash freezes in the middle of folding up his survival suit
You what
Donut
Who’s taking bets
Well the gang of course
Donut says
Wash can only assume him and the rest of the Sim Troopers
Grif is wagering a hard never but Caboose has faith
He says everyone will be best friends by tomorrow at noon
Wash groans
Great
Just great
So you all got to witness that disaster
Well yeah
Us and some of the other Feds and News who came by
Some of you know what never mind
I don’t really want to know how many people saw that
Donut sighs popping the seals on his helmet and setting it on the bench next to Wash
Wash shifts a little uncomfortably he still finds it difficult to look Donut in the face particularly when Donut’s smiling at him like they’re best friends
The feeling of guilt only gets worse when Donut presses a ration bar into his hand
C’mon eat
I’m fine Wash says automatically
Donut clicks his tongue
Listen mister either you eat that bar like a normal person or I’m going to cram it right down your throat
Which do you prefer
Wash sighs taking a seat on the bench and opening the ration bar
Donut beams as he takes an unenthusiastic bite
That’s better
You have to eat something
Tucker is just going to wear you right out otherwise
Golly that boy is enthusiastic
Wash pauses mid-bite
Huh
Well I’ve never seen him so excited
He’s been looking forward to this training session all morning he has
Sure has
Something seems to occur to Donut and he sits down next to Wash looking so serious that Wash sits up in alarm
Wash
I’ll keep everyone from watching through the door okay
Give you two some privacy
Whatwe don’t need privacyI mean we do but not why would anyone want to watch my training session with Tucker
Donut looks at him so incredulously that Wash feels a little defensive
Wash
Please
People would pay to see that
But why
Because of the Freckles Shake thing
What why do people keep saying it like that
Like it’s a thing
Wash
It’s a thing
Donut sighs dreamily Wash notes with horror and continues
I only wish I had been conscious
Kennedy says it was the most romantic thing he’s ever seen
Jesus Christ
Okay look Donut
It would be nice to not have an audience today no not because of that he adds hastily when Donut claps his hands to his mouth in delight
I’m showing Tucker some knife work and I think he might be a little nervous
Ohhhhh
Donut lowers his hands and nods wisely
I see
Absolutely Wash
I’ll keep everyone off your backs
I don’t mean Wash pauses suddenly awkward
I’m not asking you to go out of your way
Wash you can ask me for a favor
That’s what friends do
They ask each other for favors and he glances pointedly at the ration bar that Wash hasn’t finished
They take care of each other
Wash drops his eyes at that and for lack of anything else to say devours the rest of his ration bar
There he grunts crumpling the wrapper in his fist
Happy
Donut looks nothing short of thrilled
Much better
I don’t want to have to track you down about this again understood
Alright alright Donut stands then pauses before resealing his helmet to look at him imploringly
Wash when are we gonna hang out
Wash startles
Iwhat
You know
Hang out
Have some wine and cheese and just talk
Like we used to
Wash cannot recall a single time ever having wine and cheese with Donut
When did we
Donut waves a hand
Well we didn’t have any wine and cheese but we would hang out all the time at the compound
Wash supposes in retrospect that was true
Donut seemed to have a knack for finding all of Wash’s favorite brooding spots at the Federalist compound and recalls many evenings when they’d sit together
He’s a little surprised that Donut wants to recreate those moments if he calls correctly Wash had been nothing but irritable the entire time they were with the Feds
Oh
Well
I guess we canhang outsoon
If
You want
Oh really
Oh I’d love that
Wash I will find us wine and cheese
Okay
I’ll do it
You let me know when you have a free night and we are going to gossip
And with a winning smile Donut flounces out of the training room to leave Wash blinking in confusion
He shakes his head a little getting up to stretch and is still a little distracted when Tucker opens the door to the training room and leans against the doorframe
Hey there Wash
Hi Tucker
Out of your armor already I see
Nice
I dig the enthusiasm
Wash throws a half glance his way
I got here a little earlywhere’s Epsilon
Is he back with Carolina
Epsilon materializes over Tucker’s shoulder turning to glare at his friend
Oh no
I’m still here
He turns his helmeted gaze to Wash looks him up and down and says NOPE before vanishing without another word
Wash blinks
What was that about
Don’t worry about Church Tucker says
He’s still leaning against the doorframe one arm propped over his head and the other on his hip
We’ll just pretend he’s nooooot even here
Unless you like an audience
I’m cool with either
Right
Wash says slowly
He stares at Tucker
Tucker stares back
Soare you going to come in here or You bet I am Tucker says enthusiastically and he finally pushes off the wall pulling the door deliberately shut behind him
Wash blinks again
Maybe Donut was right about Tucker being excited for his training session although Wash can’t figure out why
So as I’m sure you already know training was a disaster this morning he says as Tucker walks over to where he’s stretching and glances pointedly at Wash’s paint-splattered armor
Tucker makes a sympathetic noise
Yeah not surprised in the slightest dude
Even the Feds
Even the Feds
I can’t imagine what would’ve happened if I tried to train them together
Wash pauses then grudgingly continues
I’m sorry I doubted you and Grif
I owe you
Tucker shrugs easily
That’s okay
I can think of a few things you can do to make it up to me
I owe you guys a morning off at least Wash agrees propping his leg up on the bench to stretch his hamstring
I can think of something a little more exciting than a morning off
Well just let me know what you and Grif want and I’ll decide if it’s reasonable
Not Grif just me
Hmmm
Wash asks absently stretching out his other leg
What about you
And then he blinks because Tucker props his leg up in the bench right next to Wash leaning an elbow on his knee
I said I can think of a few things you can do to make it up to me
You know
Just you
Just me
Wash pauses mid-stretch
There’s some part of his brain nagging at him trying to clue him in on some long-forgotten social cue that he should probably be picking up on but he’s a little distracted by the fact that Tucker’s crotch is for some reason really close to his face
Uhokay
Justlet me know I guess
Don’t worry Tucker says still in that same weird voice
I will
And then thank goodness he takes his leg down and moves back stretching his arms above his head
Wash doesn’t have much time to get his thoughts together though because five seconds later Tucker is removing his helmet
Wash wouldn’t normally take much notice of this except for the fact that Tucker is making what seems to be an unnecessary a production out of it
He pops the seals and removes it slowly and tosses his head the ropes of his hair flying all over the place before coming to rest on his shoulders
He flashes a thousand-watt smile at Wash and moves on to removing his gauntlets hellooooooooo
Wash startles and gives his head a little shake turning to stare at Epsilon who has just materialized on top of Tucker’s discarded helmet
Huh
I said make sure he takes it easy Epsilon says
I’ll monitor his vitals but this is the first major workout he’s had
It is not Tucker says irritably
I worked out with the guys yesterday
Tucker one lap around the training room and a few minutes lifting weights is not working out
Oh well I guess you would know right
Whatever
Epsilon turns back to Wash
Anyway
Just watch him
Of course I’m going to watch him Wash says then frowns at Tucker
Lifting weights
Should you be lifting weights this soon
Tucker pauses in the process of unsnapping his shinguard
Oh my god
They were like the lightest weights ever calm down
Hmmm Wash says but lets it go
Well we’ll mostly be focusing on technique and cardio today
Mm sounds good to me so it won’t be too strenuous on your wound
Oh and you should probably change out of your survival suit the exercise will make more sense if you’re He trails off as Tucker thumbs the release on his suit and wriggles out of it in record time kicking it off to the side not wearing it he finishes
Dude no complaints there Tucker says
He puts a hand on his hip and ruffles up his dreads making absolutely no move to put on something more than the boxer briefs and tank he’s currently wearing
I like to let things breathe during training know what I mean
Tucker Wash says and he feels his face heat up a little as Tucker bends over and starts stretching in what Wash can’t help but notice is an unnecessarily obscene manner
For the love of god put some pants on
Tucker glances around widening his eyes in what Wash is pretty certain is fake surprise
Dammit
I forgot to bring my sweats
Wash lifts an eyebrow rummaging in the bag he’s brought and wordlessly holding out a pair of sweats to Tucker
Dude
You went into my room and packed some clothes
Like my mom
Well it’s a good thing I did isn’t it
That’s one word for it Tucker mutters and reaches out to snag the pants from Wash
He’s not sure what happens next because Tucker trips over seemingly nothing and stumbles forward
Wash reaches out instinctively to catch him and Tucker must be more off balance than he thought because he does a fair amount of grabbing at Wash’s arms and shoulders
The next thing Wash knows Tucker’s in his arms leaning against his chest with his hands gripping Wash’s shoulders
Wow
Thanks dude
That was a close one
His beaming smile is inches from Wash’s face and Wash isn’t sure if he’s more distracted by that or the fact that Tucker is almost naked and for some reason making absolutely no effort to pull away or steady himself
Um he says and wishes his face didn’t feel so hot
Um
Okay he says and blinks as Tucker ups his smile to about a billion watts
Who smiles like that
Wash thinks feeling rather dazed and Tucker still hasn’t moved
Someone clears their throat and Wash jumps
He makes sure Tucker is steady on his feet before stepping away hastily to put some distance between the two of them but a quick glance around confirms that it’s only Epsilon perched on top of Tucker’s helmet
You guys gonna get started training or are you just gonna screw around all day
Wash tries to steady his pounding heart and Tucker glares murderously at Epsilon
There’s no reason to feel so nervous and guilty he tells himself
Tucker slipped and Wash steadied him
Normal
Any normal person would have done the same
Kennedy says it was the most romantic thing he’s ever seen
Wash
Please
People would pay to see that
He steps back even further despite the fact that Tucker’s already several feet away but Tucker doesn’t notice
He’s still scowling at Epsilon
Really dude
Just an innocent question Epsilon says blithely
Tucker rolls his eyes
So like are you just gonna stand there and watch or
I don’t know Epsilon says leveling his gaze at Tucker
Am I
Church Tucker grits out Log
Off
Now
Don’t tell me what to do
Dude seriously
It’s gonna distract me if you’re just sitting there
That’s what I’m hoping for Epsilon mutters
Wash looks between the two of them confused
Okay look we do need to get this going
Church come on Tucker whines
Just fucking log off and monitor my vitals or whatever the fuck from in here please
Alright Wash says
Tucker has blessedly shimmied into the sweatpants making it a little easier to think
Tucker come here
Epsilon goodbye
With a final muttered curse Epsilon vanishes
Tucker shuffles over
Don’t know why he won’t just leave already he mutters
I’m sure he’s just worried about you Tucker
Yeah yeah Tucker gestures towards the rubber training knife in Wash’s hand
Alright so teach me your ways or whatever
I’m sure I’ve got a lot to learn
He follows this up with a wink that Wash chooses to ignore
Okay
Wash straightens
You’ve made it clear that you favor close quarters combat so we’re going to work on getting you comfortable with that
I can’t teach you how to use your sword but I can teach you to use knives
Yeah you don’t need to give me a speech I know that’s why we’re here Tucker says waving a hand carelessly
And I still don’t really get it
I mean I don’t use knives so what’s the point in
Felix uses knives Wash says and Tucker’s mouth closes with an audible click of his teeth
Felix uses them and if you’re fighting him or anyone who uses them then you need to learn how to control the blade
If you lose your sword then you need to learn how to take the knife away from him and use it against him
You need to learn all of this in armor and out of armor because if you’re taken captive then no one is going to let you keep your armor
You need to learn major arteries and pressure points and just how much blood a person can lose before they pass out
Do you know why you’re here now
Yep Tucker says his blasé tone completely gone
Yep
Read you loud and clear
Knives
Let’s do it
Now
Wash hefts the training knife in his hand testing its weight
I want to jump right into knife evasion today
Just to get you used to moving while a knife is coming at you
It’s natural after an injury such as yours to develop a fear of the weapon or situation
Tucker straightens
What
I’m not afraid of knives now
And the longer we avoid training the scenario that led to your injury the more difficult it’ll be to jump back in
Okay I mean that’s fine ‘cause I’m not afraid of knives so it really doesn’t make a difference
Wash shrugs
Okay great let’s get to it then
He snags his datapad from the gym bench while Tucker fidgets in his peripheral
Come on sit down for a minute he says and Tucker shuffles over to join him on the bench
Wash regards him for a moment drumming the datapad against his thigh before plunging forward
The first thing you need to understand about a knife fight is that you are going to get cut
Tucker’s head jerks back at that eyebrows slanting down
What
Dude
What the fuck is the point of all this training if I’m just going to get carved up like a goddamn turkey anyway
The point is Wash continues calmly that it’s just something you need to be prepared for
It doesn’t take a lot of skill to use a knife and even if you’re fighting someone relatively inexperienced you will still get cut
If you’re fighting someone who is skilled then the likelihood of you bleeding is even higher
Fucking great
The point is you don’t want to drag a knife fight out
You want to get yourself out of that situation as fast as possible
And the quickest way to do that is to cut someone where it matters
He opens his datapad motioning for Tucker to lean in
I want you to look at this chart
These are the major arteries of the body Tucker your footwork is atrocious
You’re taking three steps when you should only be taking one
What does it matter as long as I get the fuck out of the way
Wash closes his eyes briefly as Tucker paces tiny circles hands on his hips and breathing hard
Two hours into their training session and Tucker still hadn’t lost the tension that had taken over his body from the moment Wash had told him that getting cut in a knife fight was guaranteed
They had moved from targeting major arteries to pivots and while Tucker is getting better there’s a definite hesitation weighting his movements down
It matters because you’re wasting precious time Wash says
You want to be close in knife fighting
If you’re too far and your opponent knows how to throw knives you’re in just as much danger
For the first time Tucker brightens a little
Ooooh can we learn that
I wanna learn to throw knives like he mimes throwing one across the room
That’s soooo badass
I’ll show you Wash says once you get these pivots down
Tucker’s frown is back
Ugh
So fucking never then
You keep pivoting away too far
Think of yourself likelike your opponent’s shadow
Stay close
Close enough that they can’t cut you
He tosses the knife to Tucker
Here
We’re going to try an evasion drill
Try to attack me
Tucker glances between the knife and Wash
What like stab you or slash or
Whatever
Do anything you can to try to cut me
I’m going to keep moving
He waits patiently for Tucker to move
When he does Wash sidesteps the attack
He stays close to Tucker’s back forcing him into wide swings and downward slashes
What the fuck dude Tucker mutters
I can’t get anywhere near you
That’s the point Wash says and lets the exercise continue on a little longer before swiftly disarming Tucker
Do you see what I did
Yeah some ridiculous ninja bullshit
I stayed close
I forced you into big movements that allowed me to disarm you
I forced you to move and I didn’t let you box me into a corner
Hmmm
Tucker regards him
Okay I guess that’s pretty cool
You’re really fast
You’re fast too Wash says and it’s true
You just don’t know how to use your speed yet
Okay Tucker fidgets a little
But like you’re gonna teach me how right
Of course I am
I want you to try this Wash says and turns to the bag he’d brought rummaging for some chalk he’d found earlier
Let’s put it all together
I’m going to try to touch you with this training knife and you’re going to do whatever you can to stop me
Pivots disarms whatever
Okay
Yeah yeah sure that sounds wait what are you doing
Wash continues to cover the blades of the knife liberally in thick red chalk
This way if I nick you you’ll be able to see where the cut is
All at once Tucker’s nervous energy multiplies
That’s a little dramatic don’t you think
I think it’ll help drive the point home
Well It’s not real Tucker Wash says
We’re just training
Tucker flares up at once
Yeah I know that I’m not an idiot Wash
Okay Wash says easily standing up to square up with him
Ready
Tucker bounces impatiently on the balls of his feet across from him
Yeah yeah let’s fucking get to it
Wash keeps things relatively easy at first giving Tucker a chance to get his nerves out but it doesn’t seem to matter
Tucker’s movements are clumsy and erratic and when Wash draws a long red stripe across his bicep with the training knife Tucker stumbles back staring at it
He looks up at Wash accusingly
You’re going easy on me
I’m not Wash says calmly
I’m just starting slow
Yeah well Felix isn’t gonna start slow is he
Tucker pauses scowling
Actually he probably would
Playing with his food before eating it and all that shit
Tucker focus
I am focused
Come on fucking try to stab me
Rule four
We don’t pull our punches in training Maine’s memory whispers and Wash hesitates
He doesn’t know if pushing Tucker will work there’s every chance that he could shut down but the longer their training session goes the more Wash thinks it might be what Tucker needs
He lunges straight at Tucker’s ribs with the knife and Tucker just barely scrambles out of the way
Wash follows him back with a downward slash and catches his shoulder
Tucker’s movements become less dynamic as the exercise continues his steps taking him solely backwards instead of varying the directions like they’d just trained
It’s all too easy to draw paint Tucker’s skin red with chalk to box him into a corner and the second Tucker feels his back hit the wall he tries to pivot under Wash’s arm
Wash catches him with a slash to the midsection and Tucker completely freezes staring at the bright red chalk marks across his white shirt
Wash takes advantage of his distraction and pushes him back against the wall the training knife under his throat
None of these wounds will kill you but you’re losing blood and your enemy has you cornered
What do you do
I
Tucker flinches hard as Wash lays the training knife across his throat
I wait just let me think
Wash tilts Tucker’s chin up with the blade
Come on
You can get out of this
Focus
I’m trying
Tucker jerks a little in his grip but not too much as if afraid of actually getting cut
Wash I don’t know what to do I don’t know what to do I don’t
You do Wash tells him and he hates himself a little at the genuine panic in Tucker’s eyes
Tucker you do
Tucker starts to struggle in earnest and the training knife draws a long red stripe across his throat
Wash I can’t I can’t I can’t
He fists his hands in Wash’s shirt pushing him away and then tugging him back as if he can’t decide whether he wants space or not
Wash lets the knife fall to the ground and puts his hands on Tucker’s shoulders as Tucker bows his head and shakes and shakes
There’s no shame in being afraid of the thing that almost killed you Wash tells him quietly
Tucker shakes his head a little still hunched over with his hands wrapped in Wash’s shirt
I was tortured once with fire andit was a long time before I could be around fire without flinching
It was a problem on missions with explosions andI was ashamed
I felt that I should be better that I should be able to just bounce back butTucker it’s not that easy
It should be Tucker mutters into his chest
It fucking should be fuck I don’t have time to deal with this shit Wash
I can’t
I need to be
I have to be better
I have to be better than this
That’s why we’re doing this Wash tells him
So that we can all be better
He lets Tucker stay there for a while his forehead pressed tight to Wash’s chest before putting a hand under Tucker’s chin and lifting his head up
You ready to try this again
Tucker’s eyes are wide and haunted but they are dry and he nods
He steps back away from Wash giving himself a little shake
Wash watches his eyes flick down taking in the harsh red chalk lines all over his body watches those same eyes steady and when Tucker glances back up his fists are clenched his eyes are nothing but hard bronzed steel and Wash has never seen anything so beautiful and so bold and so brave
Yeah
I’m ready
The thing is the Fed captains wouldn’t be all that bad if they weren’t so goddamn annoying
Despite a fair amount of badgering from both him and Grif Wash’s agreement to train the Federalist and New Republic cadets separately for a week hadn’t extended to the Captains
Truth be told they didn’t have any real reason to train separately as Wash kept pointing out he’d trained both groups and didn’t need to establish a baseline
There was also an endless litany of
You guys need to help set a good example
If the cadets see their Captains training together it might help melt the ice a little faster
After the disastrous first few days of training Wash had with said cadets Tucker decides it’s best to let the whole thing go
Dude let’s just get it over with he’d muttered to Grif at breakfast when he’d seen Grif opening his mouth to whine at Wash yet again about their daily training with the Feds
Wash had been extra quiet that morning staring off blankly while stirring a sugarless cup of coffee
He had looked exceptionally sleep deprived and Tucker didn’t have the heart to complain
It will be so fun Gruf
Caboose had yelled yanking Grif bodily out of his seat
It was far far too early for Caboose to be speaking so loudly but it got Red Team up and moving and it got Wash to crack a distracted smile so Tucker let it go
We are going to see our new best friends today
I mean they’re way too uptight right he asks Church now watching the Federalist captains do a series of perfectly synchronized push-ups and pull-ups
I think uptight is an understatement
Tucker sighs
Wash had only been at one of their workouts this past week as there wasn’t anything specific they needed to work on just yet
It’s more important that you all get used to spending some time together
Just keep up your baseline
Running strength training maybe some hand to hand
The usual
The usual seems to include the Feds doing something on one side of the room while the sim troopers dicked around on the other side
I can’t live like this Tucker thinks in despair
It’s too tense
I gotta do something
You can always try hitting on one of them too
Shut the fuck up Church
Tucker perks up slightly as he notices Captain Perry subtly glancing Caboose’s way
Caboose isn’t doing anything spectacular as far as Tucker can see and it takes him a moment to realize just why Perry is staring
Caboose is bench pressing a FUCK-ton of weight humming merrily all the while
Tucker’s so used to Caboose’s ridiculous feats of strengths that he forgets how they look to other people
Go sit on the bar he calls to Perry who jumps and instantly pretends he wasn’t watching
Tucker rolls his eyes
Dude for real
Watch
He walks over to where Caboose is resting between sets and climbs on the bar
Caboose unracks the bar again and casually pumps out a few more reps
Perry’s jaw drops and Tucker can’t really blame him
It’s pretty goddamn impressive particularly when taking into account the fact that Caboose isn’t in power armor at all and Tucker still has random bits of his on
He could probably pop Locus’s skull in between his hands one of the other Captains
Fitz says his eyes going wide
Silence
Sarge pauses in his own lifting to eyeball Fitz
Hmph
Like the way you think boy
He straightens suddenly eyes taking on a maniacal gleam
Wellnow there’s a training exercise with some practical use
Tucker blinks
What is
Training for that exact scenario
Crushing the skulls of our enemies between our very hands
Church pops up on top of Tucker’s helmet
Uh and just how are we going to train for that
It’s watermelon season Ali says suddenly and they all turn to stare at him
Genius Grif breathes and Simmons straightens in alarm
Wait you can’t really be thinking of
Simmons Grif says despairingly there are watermelons
Here
On
This
Planet
Grif glances at Ali
In the capital he asks desperation plain
In the capital
There are watermelons in the capital Simmons
Who are we to let them go to waste
But you are going to waste them
You’re going to to
Crush them like the skulls of our enemies between our very hands
Sarge reiterates and Simmons gestures
Yes
That
That’s wasting them
Grif waves a hand
We can still eat the remains
Gross Grif
Alright enough with the chit-chat
Sarge says impatiently
We need an infiltration strategy
Retrieving these watermelons will take all of our strength and skill
They’re not that far actually Fitz ventures but Sarge barrels on
You guys are idiots Church mutters and logs off again
He doesn’t stay gone for long
Tucker estimates that he reappears at least ten times in the next thirty minutes during which Sarge details their strategy to retrieve the watermelons
He pulls a whiteboard seemingly out of nowhere
Tucker literally turned around for two seconds and when he turned back Sarge was enthusiastically scribbling on a gigantic board
He attempts to draw a rough map of the capital before Donut wrests the marker out of his hands and sketches out a far more detailed map complete with a key and scale
Two dry runs and a snack break later they have all retrieved the various pieces of their armor that have ended up scattered all over the training room and are ready to go
Simmons convinces them that at least a few have to stay
If Kimball or Doyle comes in here and finds us all gone we’ll be in serious trouble and I don’t even want to think about Wash’s reaction so Tucker Caboose Simmons and Patil end up staying behind
There’s a close call when Kimball pops her head into the training room to check on them
Tucker barely manages to intercept her at the door and spin some bullshit story about how if you come in now the Feds are gonna get all defensive c’mon we’re just getting through to them but in the end she leaves
Two hours later the rest of the guys are sneaking back into the training room dragging bags of watermelons behind them
Couple of close calls
Sarge says
He’s still got his helmet on but Tucker can imagine all too well the maniacal look in his eyes
Barely managed to escape with our lives who knows what sort of diabolical torture the enemy would have subjected us to
Uh who exactly are you referring to as the enemy
Church asks
Sarge waves a hand
Those who would’ve stopped us from completing our mission
And to be clear by mission you mean stealing a few dozen watermelons and smuggling them into the training room to Church trails off as a fascinated Ali picks up a watermelon and hands it to Caboose
With nary an effort Caboose takes the watermelon squeezes enthusiastically and
POP
The watermelon explodes showering them all with squishy red chunks and after a moment of shocked silence they all burst into laughter to do that Church finishes but his tone is less exasperated and more intrigued
Huh
Nice Caboose
Thank you Church
Caboose says and in his enthusiasm picks up and bursts another watermelon
It’s the most fun Tucker can remember having in ages
They all take turns trying to pop the watermelons the biggest shock comes when Patil whom Tucker is certain hasn’t said one word up until this point pops a watermelon in two seconds steps back and goes Neat
Donut gets innovative and sends a watermelon flying across the room to smash against the wall and they experiment with crushing and stomping and following up with kicking and smashing
All methods prove to have excellent success rates of explosion upon impact
Tucker eventually unseals his helmet and sits down next to Grif to join him in eating watermelon chunks
What losers Grif observes sucking the juices from the remains of his busted out rind
Right
Tucker nods in satisfaction
Don’t even know they got played
They share a look and bump their empty rinds together because like damn mission accomplished
Donut and Perry are in a deep discussion involving the finer points of baseball and throwing Caboose and Patil are still popping watermelons Simmons is showing Ali his cyborg arm Fitz and Sarge are in a highly enthusiastic debate over just how alike a human skull is to a watermelon Wash and Carolina are observing from the doorway and
Tucker sits up straight as Wash’s jaw drops
He and Carolina are both out of their armor and covered in sweat and judging by the unhappy look on Wash’s face were probably just training hand-to-hand
Although it might have more to do with the fact that the training room and Captains are currently splattered in chunks of sticky watermelon but Tucker can’t quite be sure
He makes a slashing motion across his throat when Wash opens his mouth to probably unleash hell
Wash hesitates frowning at him and Tucker tries to convey with a series of hand gestures that
Dude we’re all getting along and working together okay we actually pulled off a successful mission and I know it was over something stupid but still no one noticed us dragging like a billion watermelons across the capital so it obviously worked and if you say something they’re gonna get all uptight and freaked out
He’s not sure just how much of that gets across but Wash puts a hand on Carolina’s elbow and mutters something to her
With a final exasperated look around the two of them melt away and Tucker falls back against the wall in relief
An hour later both the training room and their armor is reasonably free of watermelon and the Fed captains are all noticeably less wound up than they were at the beginning of the day
Maybe this wouldn’t be so bad after all
A few more training sessions like that a couple beers a bottle or two of whiskey maybe even an under-the-radar party and
Well well
Hello Captains
Wash materializes out of the shadows where he was seemingly waiting for them all to appear outside of the training room
The rest of the sim troopers falter behind Tucker before Grif whispers RUN and they all take off down the hallway dragging the Federalist captains with them
What
COME BACK HERE
Wash bellows but they’re gone
Tucker turns too late he was entirely too distracted by the fact that Wash’s sweaty t-shirt was sticking to his chest and shoulders because really who has arms like that
Tucker had felt like he was grabbing onto an iron railing when he’d executed his smooth stumble into Wash’s arms the other day
Smooth is one word for it Church mutters but Tucker ignores him
Wash reaches out to snag his wrist and although Tucker could pull away he’s in power armor and Wash isn’t after all he doesn’t
Okay look Tucker says
I know how that must’ve looked
I’m really not sure that you do
But like we actually all worked as a team
And we actually got the Feds to remove the sticks from their asses well maybe not entirely but we made a solid start
I mean who knows we may actually need to crush an enemy’s head in between our hands someday so
That’s what you were trying to simulate
Wash asks incredulously
Crushing an enemy’s skull between your hands yes
There’s a pause
That was Sarge’s idea wasn’t it
Yeah
Well
Kind of
Fitz too I guess
There’s a longer pause this time before Wash sighs
Well he says slowly
I suppose there was no harm doneunless of course you count the fact that you wasted a lot of food
We didn’t
We saved all the chunks that were still in the rinds c’mon we’re not total assholes
Everyone took a portion and we’re gonna share them with our cadets
He fumbles with the bag in his hands before withdrawing a chunk of watermelon and holding it out to Wash flashing his most winning smile
Watermelon Wash
Wash gives him a long considering look before reaching out to take the watermelon
Thank you Captain Tucker he says turning and walking down the hall and holy shit Tucker cannot believe they got away with that
He watches Wash leave unable to stop the stupid grin that’s spreading across his face
Wash should really walk around without his armor on more he decides as he continues the walk back to his room
It’s a goddamn capital crime is what it is the way the armor hides his frankly ridiculous physique
Tucker thinks his favorite part might be the chiseled jawline
Or the broad shoulders
Or the tight- Epsilon flickers to life in front of him
Oh my god Tucker get your mind out of the gutter
Hey you’re the one who decided you had to stay and babysit me says Tucker not phased in the slightest
There’s no such thing as censorship up in here
Well clearly
Epsilon regards him suspiciously
Alright Tucker look
Since you’re clearly not gonna drop thisI know what you’re thinking- unfortunately- and I’m not so sure it’s a great idea
Are you kidding me
It’s the best idea I’ve ever had says Tucker enthusiastically his mind wandering a little
Epsilon shudders
Okay I think I wanna go back to Carolina now
Good
I mean I could care less if you want to watch but I don’t think Wash is into that sort of thing
He doesn’t actually know what Wash is into which huh that was going to be fun to discover
Seriously dude
If you’re thinking I won’t fuck him with you in my head you’re wrong
I really couldn’t care less
Yeah well
There’s no way Wash is gonna do you if he knows that I’m here sooo
Which Tucker realizes with dawning horror is a good point
Wait is that your evil plan here
Stick around and mess up my game so that I never get a chance with Wash
Bingo
With one word the lazy comfortable atmosphere between the two of them turns tense and angry
Tucker stops walking spinning to face Epsilon
Dude what the fuck is your problem
Seriously
This isn’t funny anymore
Epsilon squares up with him
Look
Wash has been through a lot
We’re in the middle of a war here and he’s got a lot on his plate
Waaaait a second Tucker says slowly
Are youlecturing me on how to treat Wash
I’m just saying
What are you his big brother or something
Epsilon folds his arms over his chest and glares at Tucker
The last thing he needs is someone he trusts messing him around
Tucker’s mouth falls open
I’m not gonna mess him around
He really cares about you and if you’re just looking for a quick lay
Is that what this is about
Tucker interrupts
You think I’m gonna fuck with his head
You are fucking with his head
Tucker falters momentarily a little taken aback by the genuine anger in Epsilon’s voice
Unfortunately for Epsilon Tucker’s just as pissed
He takes a quick glance around to make sure that no one is coming down either end of the hallway because he's about to start doing some serious fucking yelling
Don’t you dare imply that I’m that I’m playing some sort of fucking mind game with him
I’m flirting with him Jesus
This is what people do Church when they wanna fuck someone
They flirt
I’m not joking around I’m not sending mixed signals and I’m not just I don’t know bored
Wash is my friend
He’s hot
I think it’d be fun if we fucked
Why are you making this so complicated
You think it’d be fun to fuck
You’re goddamn right I do
Well what about what Wash wants
For a moment Tucker is speechless with indignation before saying Dude
It’s all he can manage
Epsilon seems to realize what he’s just said because he tries to backtrack
Look I didn’t mean it like that
If you think that I would
I wouldn’t it’s not
I’m not gonna pressure Wash into doing anything he doesn’t want to
What the fuck Church
Seriously
I know I can come on a little strong but I
I would back off okay if
Alright alright I get it
Epsilon shuffles and Tucker’s pleased to see that he looks appropriately guilty
That came out wrong okay
I know you wouldn’t
I just don’t wantWash is Has it ever occurred to you that I might know Wash a little better than you do
Epsilon falters
What
I know you think of yourself as the fucking expert on Agent Washington and what his whole deal is but
What
I never said anything like that
Tucker taps the side of his head
You don’t have to remember
I can fuckinghear it or feel it or whatever
You get all weird and quiet and shut down like oh the things we’ve done and seen together
No one will ever understand
Epsilon flickers purplebluepurpleblue before steadying
You don’t you fucking make light of you have no idea
What happened with you and Wash
Tucker finishes
You’re right I don’t
Because he won’t tell me and you won’t tell me
And you know what
It’s really not any of my goddamn business
Just like this isn’t any of your business
I know that you feel guilty as fuck over whatever happened between you two but that doesn’t give you like some sort of right to make decisions for him
I’m not trying to make decisions for him
I’m trying to
I’m just trying to make you understand
No you’re not
You’re not trying to get me to understand anything
Well guess what Church
You don’t really seem to know Wash as well as you think you do and you sure as shit don’t know what he needs
" Oh
Oh
And you do
Tucker shrugs folding his arms
I might
Oh please Tucker
I mean who said anything about this whole thing just being sex
Epsilon throws up his hands
Uh you did
You do
Like all the time
Well yeah I wanna fuck him ten ways to Sunday but
Oh my GOD
But he might not even be into sex
And if he’s not into sex you wanna know what we can do
I’m sure you’re about to tell me
Sleep
Together
In a non-sex way
Epsilon stares at him
Sleep
In a non-sex way
Yeah
‘Cause you know what I know about Washington that you apparently don’t
When he’s all freaked out and wound up he calms down if you touch him
You gotta be careful and slow about it but like if you put a hand on his elbow or kinda bump into his shoulder he Tucker realizes he has his hands up in front of him trying to demonstrate
He like leans into it
He gets all quiet and justI don’t know it calms him down
Didn’t he try to kill you when you first met when you tried to wake him up from a nightmare
Yeah because I wasn’t slow about it
Tucker says impatiently
I just said you have to like make it a subtle thing
I literally tried to shake him awake
It was pretty stupid wait
How do you even know about that
Oh
Uh Did Wash tell you about that
After several moments of obviously casting around for some bullshit excuse Epsilon wilts
Yeah
He did
When
In the infirmary
He Epsilon hesitates for a while here and Tucker can practically see him carefully choosing his words
He wasafraid
Tucker’s insides freeze at that
Afraid
Of of what of me
No not of you
See this is what I mean you don’t get it he was afraid to share a room with you
He thought he’d hurt you
Tucker’s a little taken aback at those words before shaking his head
Church don’t you see what I’m saying here
He can’the can’t go it alone his entire life
He needs something normal
He needs a good fuck just to
I don’t know to fucking relax or or show himself that he can have something good
And if he doesn’t wanna bone that’s cool
We can like hug or whatever
Or just take a goddamn nap
Maybe his nightmares wouldn’t suck so much if he had someone there when he woke up
He deserves something good
Even if it’s just a night of hot sex
He deserves something good
I could be that something good
Epsilon has finally to Tucker’s relief seemed to run out of things to say
He stares at Tucker for nearly a full minute utterly still and Tucker stares right back until
Wow
Wow what
Tucker says impatiently
Nothing it’s justyou’re really into him
Fuck yeah I’m really into him
Jesus Church
Okay look
I wouldn’t hurt Wash Tucker mutters because it bothers him a lot that Church would think this that there’s the slightest chance that Wash might be thinking it
I’m not a total asshole you know
I never said you were going to hurt him intentionally
You may as well have
Alright alright I’m sorry okay
So do I have your permission
Tucker asks sarcastically
What do I need to ask you for his fucking hand in marriage or something
Epsilon snorts a little
Marriage huh
Oh shut the fuck up Church
They both fall silent for a while glaring in opposite direction before Tucker relents a little because fuck all this tension
Okay but really though
I do need to find out if he likes dudes
So if you’re not gonna tell me
You’re right I’m not
I seriously need a way to find out if he’s into dicks
Or like sex at all
You know Tucker Wash probably doesn’t know you’re into dudes either Epsilon says
When did that happen anyway
Please
I was way overdue for a bisexual awakening
I literally doubled my stock here
So what this was just suddenly a non-issue for you
Tucker shrugs
What happens in the desert stays in the desert
Unless of course you want details in which case
God Tucker Epsilon groans but Tucker’s distracted by the fact that he has a point
You really don’t think Wash knows I’m down to a fuck a guy
I mean Epsilon shrugs
It’s always like chicks with you
Tucker frowns trying to remember if he’s ever come on to a guy in Wash’s presence or make some slutty remark
To his horror he realizes
Fuck
I think you’re right
Okay this is an emergency
I’m serious
I have to fix this pronto
" Epsilon sighs loudly then pauses to look Tucker full in the face
I uh
I’m sorry
About
I didn’t mean
I’m sorry
Dude it’s fine
Kay
Epsilon shifts
We uh we good
Yes Church
We’re good
Justdon’t try to cockblock me again okay
That’s not cool
Alright alright
Deal
His perfect opportunity to let Wash know he’s into dudes presents itself as perfect opportunities often do at the most unlikely of times
He’s sitting at a corner table in the mess hall with Wash and the rest of the guys the next day when all of a sudden Carolina materializes at the end of their table helmet propped against her hip
I’ve booked us the training room for three hours this afternoon she says in a tone that suggests she’s rewarding them with a wonderful treat as opposed to punishing them
Grif makes a show of glancing around
Uh who’s us
Us
You me and everyone else sitting at this table
I want to show you guys some hand-to-hand stuff
Epsilon cackles from where he’s perched on the edge of Tucker’s cup
Oh man
This oughta be good
Sarge all but swells in indignation
Now listen here little lady
I’ve been tossing Blues around since before you were born
Unlikely Tucker mutters but Sarge ignores him
Not all of us need these remedial lessons
She never said they were remedial Sarge Wash says exasperated
Just that you could use some lessons
Sarge eyes him
Oh really Blue
We could use some lessons
Wash sighs impatiently
I meant all of us could use
Can it Frecklelancer
Seems to me that you were the only one to stumble back from your last tango with the mercs with half the bones in your body broken
Ribs Sarge
With a few broken ribs
Hardly half the bones in my body
Broken ribs a concussion a dislocated shoulder waving off any sort of help so you could weep over the body of your dying lover
Tucker perks up delighted as Wash starts sputtering
Wait are you talking about me wouldn’t let anyone take a look at your bleeding skull until you’d passed out on the floor of the Pelican
Oh please
Donut sighs propping a chin in his hand and looking at Sarge dreamily
Gosh don’t forget about the part where he just like he demonstrates vaguely with his free hand  took Tucker’s hand and just held it to his chest
Which Tucker does have some vague memories of
Wash’s terrified face over his his hand warm and steady in Tucker’s
Their gloves had been off Tucker remembers that although he isn’t sure how that happened
He eyes Wash with interest but Wash is studiously avoiding his gaze
No no you’re doing it wrong it was more like Sarge reaches across the table to grab Donut’s hand and before Tucker knows it the two of them are recreating what looks to be something straight out of a soap opera
Wash has his face buried in his hands and the soldiers at nearby tables are starting to stare
Alright alright Carolina says loudly
Tucker’s surprised she let them carry on this long until he catches her working hard to keep a smile off of her face
Focus
I want to see all of you in training room B in two hours got it
We got it boss Wash grits out as Sarge continues his dramatic retelling
He smacks Sarge upside the head as soon as Carolina clears the table and the two of them continue to gripe at each other until Kimball comes over and hisses at them all to set a better example
Tucker puts his hands behind his head and leans back to watch the show Epsilon snickering away inside his head
Three hours later and well into their training session with Carolina they are all far less amused
She’s giving them all instruction on grappling and ground fighting and Tucker isn’t the only one who’s confused
Not that I’m complaining about getting to lay down while training Grif says but why are we doing all of this training outside of our armor
We live in the stuff
Carolina folds her arms
The first thing our enemies are going to do if you are taken captive is remove your armor
Too many soldiers these days rely solely on training in armor and have no idea what to do when it’s taken away from them
That’s not going to be us
She demonstrates a few more moves with Wash and Tucker perks up a little
Getting to roll around with Wash practicing leg locks and shit
Sign him up
Tucker we’re training notdoing whatever is you’re thinking of doing Epsilon hisses and Tucker rolls his eyes
Yeah I know that thanks Church
Alright pair up and try those moves Carolina says loudly and Tucker cuts off his thoughts
He turns instinctively to Wash but Wash is narrowing his eyes at Sarge
Let’s go Colonel
You and me
Sarge sniffs
Please
What makes you want to think I want to waste valuable training time squaring off with a Blue
What’s the matter
Afraid you’ll lose
Tucker sighs in disappointment as the two of them posture dramatically and turns to see an unenthused Grif standing in front of him
Wanna get this over with
Yeah let’s go Tucker mutters after another wistful glance at Wash
So like you weren’t embarrassed Grif says to him as they square off
Huh
When Sarge and Donut were ragging on you and Wash in the mess hall
Wash was embarrassed but you weren’t
Oh well
Tucker jumps backwards out of Grif’s reach and shrugs
Yeah
I’m trying to hit that
Grif’s eyeballs bulge
What
Wash
You want to screw Wash
Uh have you seen the guy
Tucker glances pointedly over at where Wash is wrestling Sarge to the ground
I mean damn
He can pin me to the mat anytime
He yelps a little as Grif takes advantage of his distraction and slams him to the ground the air kicking out of him in a whoosh
Fuck he wheezes and tries to remember what Carolina just told him about the guard position
So when did this happen
Grif grunts batting his hands out of the way
I mean you guys had a lot of sexual tension going in the canyon but
I know Tucker sighs
Talk about wasted time
He’s tapping out as Grif gets him in a chokehold and squeezes
Jesus he gasps as Grif lets up pulling him to his feet
How did you do that
Grif shrugs
Dude it’s literally just laying on people
I hardly have to do anything
Apparently Tucker mutters
So it wasn’t the canyon Grif prompts as Tucker jumps on his back and attempts to lock in a sleeper hold
Which means it was here
It takes a lot of effort but Tucker manages to take Grif to the ground
Unfortunately this also means that Grif falls right on top of him
Well unfh yeah
I guess I
I don’t know I thought of him after I got stabbed or whatever
Grif pauses
Wait Wash was the last thing you thought of before you almost died
Well
I meanI guess yeah
Dude Grif says sympathetically as Tucker tries to lock in another chokehold you are so fucked
Tucker doesn’t have a chance to reply to that although what he would’ve said he has no idea since two seconds later Carolina is standing over top of them frowning
No no no not like that
Tucker your leg positioning is all wrong
Come here
With a sigh Tucker gets up and shuffles over to Carolina
In a few fluid movements she’s got him on the ground with her legs wrapped around his throat in something that she calls a triangle choke
He’s so busy trying to make sure that his ass is high enough up in the air for Wash to admire that he almost forgets to take note of the fact that Carolina’s gorgeous thighs are wrapped around his neck
Which like damn he’s got it bad but also unacceptable
Tucker winks at her
Think you could pop my head like a watermelon with those thighs
Carolina opens her mouth to reply scathingly but ends up sputtering as Tucker’s hair lands in her mouth
I will never understand she says desperately batting Tucker’s dreads out of her face how on Earth you got these past Basic
Tucker flips his hair directly into her face again all dramatic and slow-motion like as Carolina rolls her eyes
Please
I have my ways
I’m impressed actually Carolina says
I don’t know how you did it
Everyone I knew in Basic had a buzzed head
Tucker has a funny feeling that Carolina’s military experience differs from his in every way down to Basic training
Literally no one cared about his hair or anyone else’s hair in the military anymore but he decides not to remind Carolina of her tragic past in favor of keeping the mood light
Dude you should’ve seen the dreads my recruiter had
Down to his fucking waist
There was no way he was gonna make me chop mine off
He pauses suddenly struck by brilliance
It also probably helped that I sucked his dick
That last part is a complete lie he hadn’t realized he was into dudes back then which was a shame in retrospect because that recruiter had been fine but it’s worth it when in his peripheral he sees Wash spit out the mouthful of water he’d just chugged from his canteen
He fights back a grin as Caboose slaps Wash on the back
Yeah that’s okay baby I don’t mind if you’d rather spit Tucker adds with a wink and Wash’s face turns bright red
Christ he blushes he actually fucking blushes
Carolina rolls Tucker off of her pulling him to his feet
Gross Tucker
She turns to Wash unimpressed
Washington are you okay
Yeah Wash gasps wiping at his face
Yeah I’m good
I’m great
Think he got the point
Tucker asks Epsilon gleefully
Tucker no one is that oblivious
Trust me we all got the point
Oh my god he blushes
Did you see that
Who blushes like that
How the fuck am I supposed to control myself when he fucking blushes
This is what you call controlling yourself
Tucker’s still congratulating himself on a job well-done when Wash stops coughing and stares over at Tucker
The look is long and considering and Tucker finally finally sees something dawning on his face something that’s equal parts realization and curiosity and a soft startled something else that pulls at Tucker’s chest; disbelief or maybe hope
Wash breaks their eye contact glances down at his shirt with a frown and says Ah man I don’t even have a spare
Tucker’s jaw drops as Wash sighs heavily and takes off his shirt like he’s in a fucking porno crossing his arms and arching his back all slow and deliberate letting the shirt muss up his hair and turning half the training room on in the process
Or at least Tucker assumes so
He’s sure as fuck turned on
Wash balls the shirt up and tosses it behind him innocently turning to Carolina
I think we should rotate partners; don’t you boss
I yeah sure let’s do that Carolina says looking as if she’s seriously regretting starting this training session
Tucker frantically tries to get his brain to reboot as Wash walks over to him with water dripping all over his fucking chest half of his mouth pulled up in a smile
He asks Wash to repeat himself three times before he registers that Wash is asking him to pair up and then has to endure another twenty minutes of training with a sweaty messy-haired shirtless Washington and his fucking eighteen-pack
It’s torture sweet glorious torture because Wash is trying to show him something called side control which means he’s got Wash’s chest pressed tight to his own and Wash’s breath ghosting across his neck and Wash’s fucking hands trying to tug his limbs into the correct position
Epsilon finally materializes on top of Tucker’s discarded helmet and throws up his arms
Oh my god
I can’t take this anymore
Tucker you’re in the clear
You’re fine
You’re you’re clearly better than fine
You have my permission
Go
Just just go
Carolina take me back now please please for the love of God
And as Epsilon implants into a bewildered and annoyed Carolina Tucker is almost sure that Wash is fighting back a grin
Tucker would probably rather take another knife to the gut before admitting it but he kind of misses Epsilon once he’s gone
Epsilon had been annoying and overbearing and utterly useless in helping him decipher just why his insides came alive when Wash walked into the room these days but it had been nice kind of
Like a little best friend you can carry around in your pocket
Caboose had said that at some point and Tucker groans as the memory echoes in his head
Because yeah
Maybe something like that
Epsilon finally left
Wash asks that afternoon and Tucker nods
Yup
Finally some peace and quiet
His tone doesn’t have his usual heat in it but to his credit Wash doesn’t push
Their training session that day is on the quieter side
Tucker is still trying to get used to not having Epsilon in his head and Wash still hasn’t lost that blank exhausted look he’s had on his face for the past few days
He’s pleased though whenever Tucker keeps his head and executes a proper disarm or pivot
Better Tucker that’s much better he says and Tucker’s chest swells
They’re training in armor today working on knife evasion
Training with the knives was still nerve-wracking but it had gotten a bit better once he’d realized how freaked out he was
He’s angry at himself for the way his heart speeds up and the way his limbs often freeze but Wash’s presence is calming
Tucker feels better just knowing that he’s learning something that can make him better
He thinks for the millionth time of Wash’s hand under his chin soft and sure and the way it had settled the storm raging inside his chest
Good Wash says at the end of their session
He can hear the smile in Wash’s voice despite the exhaustion he’s so exhausted Tucker can just tell and he thinks he should say something but he doesn’t know what
You’re really getting it Tucker
We’ll meet again same time tomorrow and
Wash stops speaking his head whipping around to stare at the wall
Tucker freezes staring at him but Wash doesn’t move a muscle
Uhdude are you okay
Shhh Wash whispers absently
Tucker can only stare bewildered as Wash fiddles with the auditory filters on his helmet before taking it off completely
Tucker takes his off as well
Um I think it’s raining Wash says and he takes off down the hallway
Oh Tucker says staring at the place where Wash had previously been standing before snapping out of it and following him
Oh
Okay
Are you sure I don’t hearanything He trails off as Wash rounds the corner to one of the security doors of the compound pushing it open
Sure enough the rain is falling in sheets and Tucker wonders how he didn’t hear it before
It is
Wash says and he sounds so delighted that Tucker can only gape
It is raining
Look
Yeah
I see Tucker says and spends the next minute or two trying not to breathe or move a muscle lest he ruin this whatever this was
I know I like the rain Wash had said after that ridiculous day when Tucker had tried to get him standing in front of every red surface he could find
He could tell that those words had been important but this this wasn’t important Tucker realizes
This was everything to Wash
Wash isn’t paying him the slightest bit of attention
He’s leaning out the door as far as he can get without actually going outside and when he removes a glove to stretch out his hand to try to catch the rain Tucker can’t keep quiet any longer
Dude
Go play
Wash jumps a little turning to stare at him and Tucker panics at the way his eyes start to close off
What
Oh
I just we should go
No no really
Tucker gestures outside
You just
You look like you want to feel the rain is all
You you like the rain right
Go on it hasn’t rained in forever
I’ll hold your helmet
I haven’t seen the rain in
I mean not like this Wash trails off then straightens
Nono
No I can’t just go outside there without my helmet there’s a war going on and I
Wash no one is gonna see you
There’s this hysterical laugh threatening to climb out of Tucker’s mouth a weird pressure in his throat and he’s mortified to realize his eyes are stinging
He fights not to blink and strangles the laugh down tight
Look it’s an enclosed courtyard
See
Not even any windows looking down into here
Wash follows where Tucker’s pointing and Tucker can see the moment where he wavers
II don’tno it’s stupid
I’ll
I’ll stand watch Tucker says and for the first time Wash snaps his head around to give Tucker his full attention
You will
I will
Really
I’ll just
I’ll guard the door and like the perimeter and you just
Go feel the rain
I’ll stand watch
Wash hesitates for so long that Tucker thinks he’s not going to do it but after a final glance at Tucker he steps into the courtyard
His movements are stiff and uncertain at first but grow bolder when the water hits his face
It’s absolutely pouring and in moments Wash’s hair is soaked through
Tucker watches transfixed as Wash tilts his face up to the sky the tension from the day washing away with the water
He turns his gaze back to Tucker eyes so very bright and so very blue
His mouth opens and closes a few times and Tucker can see the hesitation on his face
I um
I’vealways liked it
The water
The the rain he says and Tucker only nods because he knows that’s not all
Iin Freelancer afterI It’s okay Tucker says and he isn’t sure if he means It’s okay you don’t have to tell me or everything will be okay I swear to fucking god it will or maybe both
Wash must hear something in his words because his voice grows stronger
After
Epsilon things weremixed up
It took a long time for me to realize what memories were mine and which wereit’s justI remembered this first
The water
It was the first thing that I knew was real
He pauses looks up at the sky
I know it’s stupid
Tucker doesn’t think he’s ever heard anything less stupid in his whole life
It’s not is all he says
Itit’s really not
The smile Wash gives him is soft and achingly sweet
Thanks
Yeah Tucker says
Yeah
Anytime yeah
Just
Yeah
Wash lets out a short startled laugh as a clap of thunder shakes the sky
Tucker watches him tilt his face back up to the sky and smile and he thinks that he could stand here forever watching Wash watch the rain
He thinks that he’d do anything fight anyone to let Wash have this peace to protect him from anyone who would do him harm
There it is
The warm safe feeling that he’d felt at the crash site after making Wash laugh
It wasn’t the light he realizes and it wasn’t even Wash’s banging bod it’s just
Wash
Just Wash in the dying sunlight in the pouring rain laughing and gorgeous and open
The rain doesn’t stop for nearly forty-eight hours
Wash can hear the distant patter from everywhere on base and it’s been a reassuring backbeat to his increasingly stressful days
He listens to it now as he grips the sink in the washroom and stares hard into the mirror
Okay he says after a final glance under the stalls and into the showers to confirm that he is in fact alone
Okay
He lifts his shirt over his head and stares at his reflection
Tired blue eyes stare back at him
He runs a hand through his hair blond and rumpled and in desperate need of a cut
He takes in the scar across the bridge of his nose the drag marks peeking out from under his hairline and the freckles dotting his face
Follows those freckles down to where they spot nearly every inch of his chest
His muscles are nice and firm but he’s hard-pressed to find a smooth patch of skin on his torso and arms where there aren’t freckles there are knife scars burn marks and old gunshot wounds
He is quite frankly a mess
So why why had his gut reaction to Tucker’s ridiculous come-ons been to strip off his own shirt and reveal said mess to the world
Wash groans resting his forehead on the mirror
He has no idea what was going through his head at that moment
None
All he knows is that he must make a decision
Wash lifts his head
Okay he tells himself firmly
He tugs back on his shirt and leaves the washroom straight-backed and determined
He knows what he needs to do
So
Yes
Ummmso uh

Donut smiles at him patiently making a get on with it gesture with his spoon
Go on spit it out
He winks
I hear that’s more your thing anyway
Wash flushes and clears his throat
Didyoustillwanttohangout
Donut pauses his spoonful of oatmeal frozen halfway to his mouth
What
Wash glances around the mess hall
You said you wanted to hang out he says a little more clearly this time
With
Uh
Wine and cheese
Or something
Oh no
Donut says crestfallen
I don’t even have any cheese yet
That’s okay Wash says hastily
I mean we don’t have to hang out if
Donut huffs
Wash don’t be ridiculous
Of course we're gonna hang out
I do have wine which is the important thing am I right
Isuppose so yes
Wonderful
So when do you want to spend some quality time together
Wash rubs the back of his neck
Uh I don’t knowtomorrow night maybe
I justI could uh use your opinion on um something
Oh wonderful
Donut says and shoots bolt upright
Okay let me just reschedule my mani-pedi party with the Feds and then we’ll be good
Oh don’t
Donut don’t reschedule anything really
Wash
Donut pauses putting a solemn hand on his forearm
Wash this is important
I can tell
Don’t you worry your pretty little freckled face about a thing
You come to my room tomorrow night and we’ll have wine and just talk
About our feelings
Kay
He takes off leaving Wash to stew in sweeping panic and sudden regret
He turns on his datapad desperate to have something to take his mind off the upcoming conversation
He pulls up the training schedule which while indeed distracting does nothing for his spirits except drop them further
There’s only one session left before he’s supposed to start training both armies together and they’re not anywhere close to ready
We can rearrange that you know Simmons says from several seats down
Give the Feds and News an extra couple practices
It takes several seconds for Simmons’ words to register
Hmm
Ohno it’ll take me ages to rework this
Simmons moves up closer to Wash tugging the chart towards him
No it won’t
Look it’s just patterns see
If we move Carolina and Kimball’s hand-to-hand back an hour and rotate up the sessions with our cadets Wash watches in fascination as Simmons rearranges the entire training schedule in less than five minutes before presenting it with a flourish
There
Now you have an extra three days
I know it’s not much but No it’s amazing he says distributing the schedule to all relevant parties with a few swipes on his datapad
Simmons thank you
Simmons lifts his head proudly
Just doing my duty sir
Which Wash has come to realize over the years is Simmons-speak for that’s what friends are for
He thinks of Donut rearranging his schedule so that they could talk and Sarge attempting to show him his super-secret-go-to-sleeper-hold in training yesterday and Tucker holding his helmet while he stood in the rain and he wonders yet again how he got here and what he did to deserve it
Wash lunges in pivotonetwo and draws the training knife across Tucker’s midsection
The chalk mark it leaves behind is bright and vivid and Tucker jolts as he glances down at it
He hasn’t stopped freezing up at the sight of all that red
It’s best Wash has learned to keep things moving when Tucker gets that startled haunted look on his face keep him focused keep him present
Okay Wash says Better but you need to keep an eye on my feet
The pivot will start from thereTucker
Are you listening
Tucker’s not listening
His hands are pressed tightly over his stomach and he’s staring in disbelief at his midsection at where the bright red chalk is bleeding through his fingers to drip on the floor
It takes Wash a moment to realize what he’s looking at because the chalk shouldn’t be melting like that shouldn’t be staining Tucker’s fingers and dripping through them like like
Tucker
He breaks Tucker’s fall laying him out on the ground
The blood is everywhere seeping not only from Tucker’s torso but from everywhere else that Wash had caught him with the chalked-up knife
Chalk he thinks wildly chalk it was just chalk the knife wasn’t real this isn’t real this isn’t
Tucker is shaking hard and Wash finds his own hands are trembling as he presses them to the wound in Tucker’s stomach
He spares a quick glance at the knife then does a double-take the blade is bright with Tucker’s blood its sharp edge visible even from here
Horror and disbelief worm their way into his chest spreading out through his limbs until his fingers and toes are numb with panic
Tucker he says Tucker
I didn’t
I didn’t mean to hold on just hold on you’re gonna be okay
Tucker’s body goes still under Wash’s hands and it is not okay
Wash’s throat closes up and when the scream finally claws its way out it’s a broken bleeding thing a wordless howl and he’s shaking Tucker and ripping at his own hair and tearing at the sheets that he’s wound around his legs and clawing at his chest because he can’t breathe he can’t breathe Tucker’s body is gone and the room is dark and there’s only starlight spilling form the tiny window at the foot of his bed and he can’t BREATHE
The window the window the window
He had a room with a window like this once tiny and circular at the foot of his bed on a ship that he called home before he really knew what that word meant before sleep used to come so easily but he will dream like this for the rest of his life; he knows this now
Dream he gasps but the word comes out high and strangled
He rips the sheets away from his body and shoves them off
His back hits the wall and he presses into it using it to ground himself
Dream
Dream
It isn’t real
It isn’t
Tucker’s body goes still and it is not okay
Nausea swoops into his stomach and strangles up his throat and he gags dropping his head between his knees struggling to suck in air
One he grits out and makes himself count to ten and back down to one when that’s not enough
Your name is Agent Washington he whispers when he gets there
You are the leader of Blue Team
You’re on Chorus
You had a nightmare
You’re fine
Tucker is fine
Tucker
Wash lifts his head glancing around his room at the sheets twisted in a corner at his pillow on the floor the bottle of water on his nightstand knocked to the ground and
Suddenly he’s furious with himself so blindingly angry
He clambers to his feet pacing around the room and running his hands through his hair because he keeps doing this he keeps forgetting
He keeps forgetting this in the daylight forgetting what his room looks like at four in the morning after a particularly bad nightmare what he looks like after a particularly bad nightmare
He keeps forgetting how long it takes him to remember his own name how he can’t breathe how there are parts of him that are still broken
He keeps forgetting that he’s a mess
He thinks again of the knives he’d laid out on the bedside table between him and Tucker in the infirmary and how Epsilon just hadn’t gotten it
How no one got it
Yet here he is still fucking it up still forgetting that he can’t let his guard down that he isn’t normal and that he can’t allow himself to do normal things like flirting
Wash stops pacing sitting down hard on the edge of his bed anger and shame and bitter disappointment knotting themselves together in his chest
Flirting
That’s what he’d been doing the other day when Tucker had made one too many suggestive comments and a lightbulb had gone on in Wash’s head
When Wash had just taken off his shirt and given it right back
He hadn’t even thought about it
It had been normal
Easy
Simple
But he isn’t normal and this isn’t easy or simple
He has no business even entertaining the idea of doing anything with Tucker and he quashes down the disappointment that wells in him at the thought
He has no business feeling that either
Wash
Wash starts guiltily when he sees Donut storming down the hallway towards him wearing fuzzy slippers and a frown
Oh uh hey Donut
Don’t ‘Hey Donut’ me
Donut folds his arms and raises his eyebrows expectantly
Are you forgetting something
We’re supposed to be having wine and cheese night
I
I know I just
God Wash you are so if you make other plans you’re supposed to tell the person you were going to hang out with
It’s not that
Wash protests
I look I wanted to talk to you about something but it’s stupid and I
Donut sighs loudly and grabs his wrist and Wash barely restrains himself from throwing Donut over his shoulder
He lets Donut drag him down the hallway Donut mutters all the while about social etiquette before tugging Wash into his room and slamming the door
Wash stares around Donut’s room
It looks exactly as he would have expected it to neat and clean with little baskets of moisturizer and scented soap and an actual wine basket fake grapes bottle opener and all
Wait you actually have wine
Where did you get that
During Operation Watermelon
Donut finishes rummaging in a drawer and pulls out not only two crystal wine glasses but monogrammed napkins as well
Wash isn’t sure why he’s surprised
Thanks he says awkwardly as Donut hands him a glass
He sits on the very edge of Donut’s bed feeling ridiculous
But where did you get it
At a bar
Of course
There are bars still open
Wash there will always be bars open
Always
It’s not a ghost town out there you know
Which Wash realizes he wouldn’t actually know
He hasn’t set foot outside of the base since arriving in Armonia
That probably wasn’t safe Donut
Donut waves a hand
It was fine
We all had our armor on
Still though
Donut sighs reaching over to pat his knee
You worry too much Wash
You all don’t worry enough
Donut settles back more comfortably against the wall
So
What’s on your mind
Wash hesitates taking a sip of his wine
I don’tI just

Okay Donut says and waits patiently until Wash starts chugging his wine
Oh c’mon let’s have it
I think Tucker’s hitting on me Wash blurts
Me specifically
Donut stares at him
Wash finds himself simultaneously relieved and a little saddened but he shoves that thought right back down
Of course he was imagining it
It was silly to think for even a second that Tucker wanted him
Silly to think
Are you joking
Wash blinks
Huh
Wait
Donut sits up a little straighter
Wait wait wait
Are you saying oh my god
You’re serious
You don’t see it
See what
Wash Donut says clearly fighting to keep a grin off of his face
Yes Tucker’s hitting on you
Is that what you wanted my opinion on
Don’t you pay any attention
Tucker hits on everyone though
I can’t tell if this is different or Oh goodness gracious Donut says
Tucker hits on everyone but he only flirts with you
I don’t know
Donut groans picking up a pillow and pressing his face into it
Oh you two
You’re like characters in a soap opera honestly
He peeks out from behind the pillow and peers at Wash despairingly
Y’know if you guys got together in the nextsay three days then I am going to be very rich
What does that even mean
It means that I’ll win the betting pool
There’s a betting pool
Donut gestures desperately
See this is what I mean
Everyone sees it but you
This is stupid Wash mutters and takes another despairing sip of wine
It’s stupid
Wash it’s not
Why are you making this so complicated
I’m not
I mean why is it so incomprehensible that Tucker wants you
Wash stop staring at Donut
I don’tDonut I can’t
But why can’t you
There is not enough wine in the world for this conversation
First of all I haven’t hadI haven’t
In a long time
What had sex yes
Donut waves a hand
Well I think Tucker’s the perfect person to get you back in the groove
Wash decides to skate over that particular topic which is rife with its own list of issues that he doesn’t think he can get into with Donut
Besides there are more important problems at hand
That asideit would be highly irresponsible of me toto be with someone Wash says stiffly
If we were to fall asleepafterI could hurt him
Oh Wash
You know what my nightmares are like
He can’t look at Donut
I can’t have someone in bed next to me while I’m sleeping
You’re not nearly as violent as you think you are after a nightmare you know
I mean sometimes you wake up swinging butyou never hurt Sarge or me in the Fed compound you know
Not once
Donut smiles at him sympathetic but not pitying
You were mostly just scared
Wash closes his eyes
I almost killed Tucker
After Sidewinder
I put my hands on his neck Donut
But that was years ago
And you were in a new environment and you didn’t trust each other yet
Maybemaybe this is just what you need to make the nightmares go away
To have someone next to you
So what I should just risk it
Wash says and tries to take the sharp note out of his voice
I can’t
I won’t risk Tucker’s life just because I wantjust so I can But what about your life
What
Donut sighs
What are you just going to go it alone for the rest of your life
Never hold hands or kiss or make love again
That’s not fair
It’s what I deserve
Donut looks at him sharply
I hate that you still think that
Well it’s true Wash snaps back
I don’tthis is Tucker we’re talking about here
I don’t des
Don’t Donut says voice angry and fierce in a way Wash has never heard
Don’t you dare finish that sentence Washington if what you’re about to say is ‘Tucker’s too good for me I don’t deserve him
’ Wash clenches his jaw lifting his chin
Well
No
No Donut says
He puts his glass of wine on the crate next to his bed and faces Wash head-on
You can just stop right there mister
I don’t want to hear it
In fact I don’t want to hear you talk about yourself like this ever again
Like what
Like you’re like you’re this broken toy who should be tossed aside and never played with again
You’re not broken and you do deserve to be played with
Donut
And what about Tucker huh
Huh
Who gave you the right to decide what he does and doesn’t deserve
I don’t that’s not what I
Tucker’s a big boy Wash
He can decide what he wants and he wants you
He wants you and you want him
I know you do
Justjust let yourself have this
I don’t know how Wash says
He’s finding it difficult to look at Donut again
I don’t know how to anymore
Then figure it out together
It’ll come back to you soon enough
Wash is silent for a while fiddling with the edge of Donut’s bedspread
Soso I’m not imaging it you don’t think
No Wash
You’re not imaging it
Donut gives him that half-smile again
You really don’t see the way he looks at you do you
I
Well start paying attention then
You’ll see it soon enough
Britton
Pay attention
Cadet Britton jumps guiltily from where she’s clustered with a few of her friends whispering in a corner of the training room
Wash can’t understand it
They’re supposed to be working on rifle disarms today and the cadets are even more unfocused than usual
There’s an excitable distracted energy vibrating around the room this is the fifth time Wash has had to yell at the cadets for standing around and gossiping
Gossiping
There’s really no other word for it
He watches as Jensen wanders away from Britton when she thinks Wash isn’t looking to cup her hands around the auditory filters of Prajapati’s helmet
Wash sighs
Everyone stop
He has to yell it three more times before the cadets stand up straight and listen to him
Or as Wash suspects pretend to listen to him
Is there a reason why you’re all so distracted today
Even the sir no sir that echoes around the room is unenthused
Are my lessons boring you
Sir no sir
That one is slightly more energized but not by much
Well then what’s the problem
Silence
Wash lets it sit for an awkward thirty seconds before waving them all back to their training
He stalks around observing the cadets in pairs about to chalk the day up to a total loss when the ka-BLAM of a rifle discharging ricochets around the room
Wash is spinning around before the sound has finished its reverberations sweeping the nearest pair of cadets behind him and bringing his own rifle up to bear
It takes him several seconds to identify what just happened there’s no assailant at the door no cadets lying bloody on the ground
There’s only Britton one hand clutching her smoking shotgun and the other clapped over the mouth of her visor
Private Britton he says and they all glance around nervously at his tone
Wash marches over and snatches the rifle away from her emptying the live bullets into his hand
Live rounds he says when he’s able to speak again
Live rounds from your real rifle
I’m sorry Agent Washington she whispers both hands clapped to her visor now
I
Wash holds up a hand and she quiets
I want you to explain to me why you are training with your real rifle instead of the training rifle like everyone else
He gestures towards the neat pile of guns piled up by the doorway of the training room noting with despair that the rest of the cadets are surreptitiously checking their own rifles to make sure they are using the correct one
Were my instructions not explicitly clear
They were clear sir she mumbles at the floor
Stand up straight he says sharply and her head snaps back up to attention
Remind me again why we’re using the training guns in every exercise and not our real ones
Because the army is low on ammunition and it is vital that we do not waste a single bullet she parrots voice wavering
Correct
Because the army is low on ammunition and it is vital that we do not waste a single bullet
He glances around the room before turning back to Britton
I know you all know this
But far more importantly you could have killed someone
I know sir and I’m sorry I f-forgot
He wants to scream
Private Britton
I don’t ever want to hear the words I forgot come out of your mouth again
You can’t forget something like this
It’s unacceptable completely unacceptable and and are you crying
Britton sniffles loudly and she is
She is crying
What
Britton pull yourself together
I’m sorry she wails
I know I’m the worst soldier e-ever and I d-don’t deserve to wear this armor a-and She descends into hiccupping sobs while Wash stares bewildered
He’s reminded vividly of his youngest sister who sounded just like this when she was hysterical when she was a teenager when she was so young
How old are you he asks
Britton says nothing only continues to sob
Britton
Take off your helmet
After a moment of hesitation and some fumbling with the seals on her helmet Britton lifts it off of her head to reveal a young heart-shaped face and the biggest brown eyes he’s ever seen
How old are you
Fifteen sir she sniffles bravely and Wash’s stomach hits the floor
It’s a few moments before he can remember how to speak
Everyone take off your helmets
Now
And then he’s surrounded by three dozen long-faced teary eyed kids
He keeps his own helmet on long enough to get his face under control before removing it because it seems wrong somehow to stand here faceless in front of such young faces
Why he asks and he’s not even sure what question he’s asking until Bitters scowls at him
’Cause there’s no one left that’s why
Wash looks around the room at all of them again before taking a deep breath
Okay
Okay
Britton it’sit’slook
You have to be more careful alright
You could’ve really hurt someone or yourself
She nods still sniffling as he hands the bullets and rifle back to her
I’m sorry Agent Washington she says again
I
I won’t forget again
Okay Britton
Okay
You please stop crying
I
I can’t she sobs
Everything is just so horrible
Laura and Martin broke up last night and they’ve been together since the beginning of the war and the servers to the base keep shorting out so we can’t download the next season of Grey’s Anatomy and and and everything is just so horrible
Is that why you’re all upset he asks glancing around
Because ofLaura and Mark
Martin
Sorry
Martin and because you can’twatch the next episode of thisTV show
A series of downcast and sullen nods are all the answer he needs
There are so many things he could say this is war we’ve more important things to worry about there’s no time for this sort of thing suck it up but none of them feel right
These are kids standing in front of him not hardened soldiers and even if they were he doesn’t think such harsh words would help
He thinks after Freelancer after the leaderboard that everyone deserves to have something be it a TV show or the feel of rain on their face
Wash straightens
Everyone helmets on
We have a new training objective
The cadets all hesitate glancing at one another
What are we doing
Jensen asks
I’ll tell you in a minute
They all exchange another series of glances before starting to reseal their helmets
Wordless communication he notes with surprise
They can use that
They can definitely use that
He files it away for later
Lieutenants Palomo Andersmith Bitters and Jensen
Your mission is to find Captain Simmons and tell him that Agent Washington requests his presence in the war meeting room
The three of them look at each other before shrugging a little and edging towards the door
Some mission Bitters mutters
Lieutenants
You must not be seen
They stare at him
Byanyone
Jensen asks slowly
By anyone
But but that’s going to be impossible
Palomo wails
How are we gonna pull that off
By any means necessary Wash says solemnly
Andersmith you’ll take point on this mission
Maintain radio contact with myself and Britton
Why me
Britton pipes
You’ll be heading the other mission
Britton sniffs loudly
But
No buts Wash says sternly
You Martinez and Prajapati will be heading to the armory
You are to locate the robot Lopez and ask for his assistance
If he will grant it you will lead him to the war meeting room as well
You speak Spanish
What
Um well

Marinez turns big eyes to Britton
She does
Like perfectly
I mean yes I do but
Parajapati whirls on Britton
You have to
You speak Spanish like an angel
Wash interrupts before the conversation can get further waylaid
Don’t get caught
Martinez fidgets
There’s no way we’re not going to get caught
Then you need to find a way Private
We don’t have much time
Wash clears his throat
The season premiere is tonight right
They stare at him
Season premiere
Britton asks voice lifting
You mean
If we’re all going to watch Grey’s Anatomy then we need to get moving
There’s a beat of silence before the cadets all start whispering to each other ecstatically but fall silent again when Wash holds up his hand
Alright
The rest of you
We’re going to divide up by groups of four and make our way to the war meeting room
Now remember we must not be seen
They aren’t seen
The cadets are filled with a giddy determination that has Wash grinning under his helmet
His heart swells with pride as he listens to the play-by-play of the Lieutenants sneak right past Carolina as he listens to Britton make a passionate tearful case to Lopez
He’s not sure if Lopez is just so grateful to hear someone else speaking Spanish or if Lopez also wants to watch Grey’s Anatomy but he agrees to go with the cadets
Wash ferries the cadets in their groups to the meeting room but he doesn’t have to do much
He’s in the middle of watching his current group tip toe right behind Kimball when a message pops up on his HUD
SMS
Are you really trying to orchestrate an illicit Grey’s Anatomy viewing party or are the cadets trying to get me into trouble
WSH
I don’t know if I would call it an illicit party but
Something like that
SMS
And why do you need my help to do it
WSH
I need you to hook up the livestream
None of them can figure it out
SMS
Do you know how much trouble we’re going to get into if Kimball or Doyle finds out
WSH
How exactly is this any different than you rigging Basebook onto all the internal servers
A pause then
SMS
I’ll see you soon
By the time all of the cadets and Wash are inside the meeting room Simmons and Lopez have managed to get the stream working
Lopez and Simmons are bickering furiously fiddling with the wires as Britton bounces in between the two of them to translate
Her helmet is off brown eyes shining and as Wash looks around the room he sees that most of the cadets have their helmets off
They’re all crowding around the monitor but listen when Wash instructs them all to set a watch schedule at the door
Wash himself stands just outside the hallway alternating between watching to make sure no one’s coming and peering into watch the cadets
Bits of their armor are scattered around the room and Palomo has distributed bags of popcorn
They lean up against each other guns in their laps and sitting closer than any normal group of teenagers would but they laugh and cheer and throw popcorn at the screen and Wash realizes that he just might give a damn about this planet after all
There is no sudden or drastic change in the cadets’ training or skill level
They still whine
They still drop their rifles
They still argue and complain about the Feds and sometimes to Wash’s horror cry
But they trust him now and that is no small thing
And they are getting better
They take full advantage of the three golden days that Simmons gave them with his rearranging of the training schedule
A tense yet focused determination settles over their training session and the cadets are as Palomo puts it
Sure as shit not gonna make asses out of ourselves in front of those hoity-toity Feds
Wash watches beaming on the last day as Britton leads half of the group through a textbook infiltration strategy
He’d been focusing hard on teaching them to communicate during training using hand signals concise radio talk and the text reader on their HUDs
They do work quite well together when they’re paying attention to each other and Wash makes a point to tell them this as they all gather around him delighted after their successful training session
It was easy
Britton says grinning from ear to ear
We just figured it was like okay you know when you’re in a room with your best friend and someone says something stupid and you look over at them but they’re already looking at you
Er Wash says blankly before he remembers the sheer amount of times he’s exchanged a significant glance with Tucker in light of the Reds antics
Eryes I think so
Well it’s just like that
Britton says
Except with guns and fighting stuff
Isuppose it is Wash says
He can’t help but smile at all of their enthusiasm
Alright great work today everyone
We begin joint practices with the Feds tomorrow don’t start Prajapati and I think you’re all going to do well
I’mproud of you
He’s a little flustered when they all look at him like he hung the sun in the sky and grows even more so when Britton throws her arms around his waist
Thank you Agent Washington she mumbles and Wash blinks down at the top of her head grateful that he has his helmet on
Um
Yes
You’re welcome
Nownow let’s have three cool down laps around the perimeter and we’ll call it a day
They take off with only a minimal amount of grumbling and Wash watches them rather fondly
Dude
I think it’s love
Wash turns to see Tucker leaning in the doorway
I what
What did you just say
The cadets Tucker says gesturing
Pretty sure they’re in love with you
Oh stop
They’ve come a long way is all
I’ll say
They actually looked pretty goddamn legit running that infiltration
Hmmm Wash says
Yeah
They do
They do look good
It’s not the only thing that looks good
Tucker comes to stand next to Wash observing the cadets running their laps
Oh Wash says as Tucker looks him up and down
Which is ridiculous because they are both in full power armor
Not like the other day when they’d been grappling out of armor with only the thin fabric of Tucker’s shirt between them
Training with the Feds starts tomorrow right
Tucker asks casually
Glad to see the cadets aren’t gonna look like total asshats
I’d never hear the end of it from Ali
Wash glances at him
You’re all getting along with the Federalist captains then
Eh
Tucker lifts one shoulder up in a shrug
They’re okay I guess
Wash says nothing only smiles a little to himself
They settle into a comfortable silence during which Wash tries and fails to ignore Tucker’s eyes on him
What
Heard what you did
With the cadets
And that show they like
You heard about that
Sure did
Tucker snickers
Palomo literally would not shut the fuck up about it yesterday
I justthey’re so young Tucker
Tucker sighs
I know
It fucking sucks
It fucking sucks Wash echoes grimly
Tucker gives his shoulder a little push
Hey
It was pretty cool though
Made them all real happy
Yeah
Yeah says Tucker
Although I gotta say
Wish you handed out rewards during our training sessions
Wash looks out of the corner of his eye
Uh huh he says slowly
Like I would probably be a lot more motivated to get better at knife fighting if I had some incentive know what I mean
Jesus Christ
There it is again
That tone
That tone he’d thought Tucker used on everyone but Donut was insisting that these days Tucker more or less reserved for him
That tone that makes Wash do ridiculous things like take his shirt off in full view of all of their friends and shamelessly ask Tucker if he wanted to partner up so that he could watch Tucker shiver slightly while Wash muttered instructions on arm positioning right into his ear in full view of all of their friends
Hey Wash
Tucker’s tapping on his helmet
You in there
Wash jumps
Yeah yes yep
I’m here
What uh
What were we talking about
We were talking about possibly implementing some training rewards for me
Tucker this has to stop
It’s highly inappropriate
Is what Wash should say
What he actually says is Welllllll I suppose I do still owe you for helping me figure out the training schedule
Fuck yeah you do
Tucker says enthusiastically
Don’t worry I’ve got a few ideas
Oh really
Wash folds his arms across his chest
Well go on
Let’s hear them
Stop it Wash tells himself furiously but his stupid mouth isn’t listening to his stupid brain and Tucker’s already zeroed in on his words
Well for starters Tucker says without missing a beat
I think I was a little unclear on that grappling thing you were showing me the other day that seat control thing
Side control
Yeah
That
Whatever
I could use some private instruction on that don’t you think
Maybe a review of the mount position as well
Before Wash can formulate a response Tucker takes off his stupid helmet and flips his stupid hair all around and gives Wash that stupid sultry wink
Feel free to stop by my room anytime Wash
I can think of plenty of things you can do to reward me
And he’s off strutting out of the training room
Point to Tucker Wash thinks before snapping himself out of it
This was getting ridiculous
How was he supposed to concentrate on anything when Tucker went around talking about the mount position
How is he supposed to
Look a voice breathes in a carrying whisper
Agent Washington loves him
Kennedy shhhhhh his friend hisses but Wash is already whipping around to see half the cadets huddled fifteen feet away not even pretending to run laps anymore
Wait a second
Wash yells as they all start to scamper
He looks hard at the first soldier who spoke something clicking in his head
You’re Kennedy
That’scorrect sir Kennedy says fidgeting
You’re the Kennedy who’s beenwho’s been He can’t finish that sentence
He stares at Kennedy for a while
Kennedy who is at least six foot three and has a voice deeper than Andersmith’s for God’s sake before waving a hand
You’reyou’re all dismissed
Wash has to work harder and harder to put Tucker’s antics to the back of his mind and he has to admit that Donut might have a point when Tucker finds a way to get even more obvious during their next training session
It’s getting difficult to convince himself that Tucker is just being Tucker particularly when like now
Tucker is taking the hand Wash offered him after knocking him to the mat during sparring practice and using the opportunity to feel up every inch of Wash’s arms as he stands
Particularly when Tucker winks at him and goes Damn Wash
Bet those are some good arms for wall sex
Thing is Tucker doesn’t say stuff like that to other people
Not recently
He still makes lewd jokes and throws around inappropriate winks but he isn’t putting nearly the same amount of effort into hitting on the rest of the base as he is to hitting on Wash
For what
Wash sputters
How does how does one have good arms for wall sex
Tucker shrugs
Well you know
You could hold someone up and just just pound away without ever getting tired
The universe apparently hates Wash Tucker walks over to the nearest wall and demonstrates
Tucker Wash says trying and failing to keep from blushing as Tucker does something unspeakably obscene with his hips
Will you please come over here and focus on the lesson
He’s just being Tucker Wash reminds himself as Tucker sashays back over to him
Just Tucker
I’m just complimenting your awesome wall sex arms dude Tucker says the perfect picture of innocence and Wash desperately tries to get his blushing under control
Wellwell
Thanks
Tucker he pauses glancing at Tucker out of the corner of his eye
I suppose they are pretty good for stamina
Tucker’s jaw drops a little before his whole face splits into a grin
Mmm
I bet they are
He isn’t imagining that
He can’t be
Tucker looks ready to eat him alive
Or is that how he always looks at people training him
He doesn’t look at Carolina like that does he
Wash can’t quite be sure
Focus he tells himself firmly and shoves all thoughts of Tucker and his bedroom eyes aside
Anyway he says trying to sound authoritative and not flustered
Anyway
Judo throws
Let’s get back to it
Whatever you say sir Tucker says in what is most definitely not a seductive tone
Most
Definitely
Not
After a few more minutes Tucker settles down enough to focus on their actual training
Wash has learned that it’s best to let him get it out of his system first it used to mean his whining and complaining although recently it more aptly describes his pick-up line practice before trying to get him to focus
The thing is Tucker’s good
Particularly at hand-to-hand
He’s a decent shot with a rifle as well but it’s clear that he’s meant for close-quarters combat
They haven’t had a breakthrough in knife training yet but Tucker is trying and getting a little better each day
His hand-to-hand combat however is improving by leaps and bounds
He’s fast movements confident and sure and the practices are becoming more and more of a challenge for Wash as well
It’s fun sparring with Tucker
There’s something light and easy between the two of them when they sink into a rhythm and he often feels like he’s just hanging out with a friend as opposed to training someone
Tucker’s movements are unpredictable and it keeps Wash on his toes
The square up to do some light sparring no armor but no gloves either
Focus on the takedown Wash tells Tucker and it isn’t long before they fall into a comfortable groove
Tucker’s brow is furrowed in concentration as his eyes track Wash’s movements and although he has to move quickly Wash is able to avoid his hits and takedowns until he’s spinning to the left and
He either reads Tucker’s body language wrong or Tucker really has gotten just that fast when he’s paying attention because he fires off a roundhouse kick at the exact moment that Wash spins to the left
Tucker’s shin connects with his ribs and knocks all the breath from his body and the next thing Wash knows he’s flat on his back blinking dazedly up at the ceiling
Holy shit
Tucker’s hovering over him horrified
Fuck me
Tell me I didn’t re-break your ribs please tell me I’m not gonna be the sixth time you’ve broken them fucking fuck I didn’t mean to kick you that hard
See this is why we need to wear sparring gear you crazy fucker
Tucker it’s okay Wash says once he’s able to breathe again
He props himself up on his elbows placing a hand gingerly on his ribs
They’re not broken
Like you’d tell me if they were Tucker mutters dropping to his knees beside Wash
C’mon let me see
They’re fine Wash protests albeit a little breathlessly
It was just a good kick
A really good kick actually
Nice job
Tucker averts his eyes for a moment
Thanks
Although you shouldn’t be thanking me for nearly fucking kill you
He hesitates hands hovering over Wash’s torso
Can I
Wash tuts impatiently
You’re not going to be able to see if they’re cracked Tucker
Well it’ll make me feel better
Fine fine
Wash gestures
Go ahead
Tucker rolls up his shirt gingerly prodding at Wash’s ribs
Okay welleverything looksnormal here
Yeah
Normal
Wash rolls his eyes
See
I told you
But Tucker is still staring at his torso fascinated
Dude you have so many scars
You’ve seen my scars before Wash says mouth going unexpectedly dry
He should move
He needs to move
He knows that look on Tucker’s face and he should move
Yeah I know Tucker says
They were kinda hard to miss when you were training shirtless the other day
You know
When you were trying your hardest to drive me crazy
My shirt was wet Wash says intelligently
I had to take it off
Hmmm Tucker says
Kay
Whatever you say Wash
Tucker’s eyes travel across to his other side to where the burn scars stretch down his ribs
Those are burn marks aren’t they
Is that from when you were tortured
The one that made you afraid of fire
Tucker takes his hand and traces his fingertips along the puckered skin as he speaks and Wash gasps
The thing that shoots through him is so foreign and half-forgotten that he jolts thinking his skin is on fire again
He grabs at Tucker’s hand intending to push him away but in his haste he flattens Tucker’s palm out against his ribs
The feeling intensifies and he is burning the place where Tucker’s touching his bare skin tingling and searing
Tucker’s staring at him with wide eyes frozen
What
What
Did I hurt you
No Wash says and why why is his voice so high and strangled
No it doesn’t hurt it It doesn’t hurt not at all his skin is on fire but there’s no pain it feels
It feels
Tucker tilts his head confused but he still hasn’t moved his hand
Wash hasn’t moved either
He’s too shocked too elated at this feeling that he’d thought gone forever this heat that’s spreading from where Tucker’s palm rests all the way out to his fingers and toes
He should move
He should move he shouldn’t be doing this shouldn’t be feeling this but his limbs have gone weak and heavy under Tucker’s touch and they won’t listen to the directions from his muddled brain
The frozen confused look on Tucker’s face changes suddenly his eyes turning dark and curious
He moves his thumb a little in soothing reassuring circles before he moves his whole hand
He drags his palm slowly from Wash’s ribs to rest low on his abdomen directly above where his belly is pulling and twisting like liquid fire the heating spreading and sparking along his skin
Tucker’s still watching him with that dark questioning look in his eyes his fingertips trailing just below the band of Wash’s sweatpants and Wash can’t breathe; he moves his legs restlessly and tries to think
The training room door swings open with a bang and the group of Feds Wash is supposed to be training next comes storming in laughing and talking
Tucker pulls back in one smooth motion rising to his feet and offering a hand to Wash
Wash takes it allows Tucker to help him up holds Tucker’s hand for a beat too long and says Thanks
Tucker
Tucker smirks at him and says Don’t thank me yet in a voice that’s nothing like his usual sleazy pick-up voice but something velvet and unwavering and he turns and fucking saunters out of the room without a backwards glance
It’s hours later before Wash collapses onto his bed blessedly alone with the door locked
The day had at least been a busy one and he’d had no time to think about what may or may not have almost happened between him and Tucker in the training room
Now though
Now he needs to focus
Wash sits up on his bunk leaning back against the wall and folding his legs
He puts his hand where Tucker’s had been on his ribs and then traces it down to where it had rested so low on his abdomen right above where Wash’s insides had been pulling and twisting in a way that he hadn’t felt in years when he’d felthe’d felt He’d felthot and well
Bothered
Which he’d thought was impossible
He hadn’t felt even slightly hot and bothered since Freelancer since before Epsilon since before his head had been ripped apart
There had been brain damage he knows his doctor Tronosky had explained it to him multiple times but they’d driven Tronosky away before he’d been able to fully comprehend his words and what they meant
Wash had lost so much from his years in recovery and there had been no shortage of consequences
Memory loss panic attacks sometimes hallucinations and other problems that he was still to this day figuring out
Including he’d thought the complete loss of his sex drive
It had been a long time before he’d even noticed that he hadn’t gotten an erection since before Epsilon
He’d had far far more important things to think about in recovery and it wasn’t until he was a few months out that the thought had crossed his mind
He remembers several times sitting in his bunk just like this trying to get something going but there had been nothing no reaction at all
It’s fine he had told himself and it largely was
He couldn’t imagine ever relaxing enough to actually be with someone again and while it would’ve been nice to jerk off every now and then it wasn’t the worst thing in the world
That part of his life was over
Until
Wash closes his eyes and thinks again of Tucker and the way his palm against Wash’s skin had burned and blazed
His eyes had gone dark and curious and deliberate and Wash wonders with a thrill of excitement what would’ve happened if the door hadn’t opened
If Tucker would’ve moved his hand even lower if his touch would’ve been confident and deliberate or tantalizing and slow
And suddenly just like that like it’s no big deal like it happens all the time he is hard
Wash’s eyes fly open and he gets his hand in his pants peering down and yep there’s his dick ready to go actually hard for the first time in years and holy fuck he’s not going to waste it
He wraps a hand around himself and thinks after a moment of guilty hesitation of Tucker and the training room
Thinks of Tucker slipping his hand all the way under the band of Wash’s sweatpants to rub at him just enough to be deliberate but not enough to fully satisfy
Thinks of Tucker pushing Wash’s shoulders down to climb on top of him thinks of Tucker kissing him
Wash latches onto this onto the thought of Tucker’s mouth
His lips looked so soft Wash wonders how they’d feel on his own how they’d feel sucking on his neck or traveling down down down and he thinks of Tucker’s mouth on his cock and then he’s coming all over his hand his sweats the bed shaking from both the pleasure and the pain of his first orgasm in so long
Oh my god he says out loud and laughs a little
It’s not until he’s stumbling over to grab a towel and clean himself off and change the sheets that it hits him really hits him that it’s Tucker Tucker who just got him off who he has to train with alone six days out of the week Tucker who he isn’t supposed to be flirting with
Tucker who is beautiful and brave and no matter what Donut says far far too good for him
Ah fuck
Tucker isn’t sure how he can be expected to get anything productive done ever again now that he knows just how melty Wash can get
Sensitive
Responsive
Clearly starved for affection
Whatever
All of those words applied but none of them fit quite as well as melty
That was what Wash had done under his touch in the training room the other day he’d started to melt and now Tucker still can’t fucking think straight
He knows they’re in the middle of a war
He knows that the stakes are high that there are peoples’ lives on the line that he should be paying attention to this meeting that he’s currently sitting in
He really and truly knows that
The problem is that Wash is also attending the meeting which makes focusing impossible
All Tucker can think about is how Wash had pressed up into Tucker’s hand when he’d laid it across his ribs
It had made Tucker feel horny and protective and tender all at once an admittedly weird mix of feelings but since the horny part was the most pressing he didn’t question it
Jesus fuck it’s too much to keep in his head
He’s going to lose his mind just thinking about it but he can’t stop thinking about it because Wash’s eyes are wide and dazed as he blinks up at Tucker from the training mats
He’s propped up on his elbows Tucker hovering over him with his hand pressed tight to Wash’s side
His breath is coming shaky and shallow and Tucker suspects it’s no longer from the roundhouse kick that knocked him down
Tucker’s own eyes travel all over Wash’s features taking in the flushed cheeks the slightly parted lips the messy hair the bewildered eyes
Tucker knows that face
There’s confusion and tension and uncertainty but
There is also want
Tucker moves his hand ever so slightly trailing it from Wash’s ribs to rest low on his abdomen
Wash’s eyes flutter at the movement and he swallows hard as Tucker dips his fingertips below the band of Wash’s sweatpants then back up
He does it again trailing them further this time to drag underneath the band of Wash’s briefs
He wonders if Wash is even aware of the way he’s squirming legs and hips moving restlessly to try to urge Tucker’s hand lower
Tucker allows himself one more teasing brush just above where Wash wants it before dipping lower still to wrap his hand around Wash’s half-hard dick
Wash gasps head tipping backwards as Tucker slowly strokes
He can feel Wash’s cock is hardening in his grip and when he swipes his thumb over the tip Wash’s hips snap forward
Wash is biting his lip hard fists clenched and Tucker can see that he’s desperately trying to get himself under control which
Unacceptable
He moves forward and attaches his lips to the cluster of freckles nestled in Wash’s collarbone and is rewarded when Wash groans between gasps
Tucker keeps it up all suction and teeth on Wash’s neck and before long Wash is wilting back onto the mats hands winding hesitantly into Tucker’s hair
Tucker moves his hand faster and lines his own dick up with Wash’s thigh grinding hard
Wash groans again at the contact hands tightening in Tucker’s hair and oh yeah more of that yes please
Tucker Wash pants right into his ear
Tucker
Tucker
Are you listening
Tucker snaps reluctantly out of what was shaping up to be an absolutely A-plus daydream to blink at a Wash who is not in fact melting beneath his touch but glaring at him from across the room
Yes I’m listening geez
Oh really
Wash says dryly
Then why didn’t you answer me the first three times I called your name
I was thinking about how badly I want to fuck you on the training room floor
Well if you really wanna know
I don’t
I really don’t Tucker
What I want is for you to pay attention to what Carolina and Epsilon are saying about the manifest they decrypted
This is important
It could be the difference between life and death
Wash folds his arms
Understood
Understoodsir
Tucker says drawing out the last word deliberately
Bet I could get you to call me sir
Bet I could get you to drop and give me twenty just for the chance to suck my dick
It probably wouldn’t even take all that much
Wash was so responsive had jolted like he’d been electrocuted when Tucker touched his skin; and all Tucker can think about is how he could make Wash feel so good that he’d scream the walls of the base down
Now though Wash has his disapproving helmet tilt on fucking lock so Tucker reluctantly tunes back into the conversation
Epsilon has been rambling on and on for about a thousand years about what he had decrypted from the manifest they’d retrieved before the disaster at the tower
He’s in the middle of talking about Charon Industries and Wash and Carolina are exchanging what Tucker can tell are darkly significant looks even with both of their helmets on
Which yeah Tucker supposes it’s kind of fucked up that Charon Industries has their hand in this but they’d been systematically working to wipe out an entire planet
It was fucked up no matter who was behind it
Honestly Tucker really couldn’t care less about the labels of it
A quick glance around the room proves that the rest of the Reds and Blues feel similarly and the CEO’s name Epsilon concludes dramatically Is Malcolm Hargrove
Silence
Wash and Carolina exchange yet another dramatic glance
Uh Tucker ventures
Who
Malcolm Hargrove Epsilon emphasizes sounding rather disgruntled that his delivery of such news didn’t get a bigger reaction
Tucker figures he and Carolina have probably been rehearsing this revelation to each other for at least two days
Carolina herself seems beyond words
The oversight sub-committee chairman
Of Project Freelancer
More blank staring
Epsilon sighs loudly
He literally shook all of your hands after we took down Freelancer
Oh yeah
Tucker rolls his eyes
Oh-ho my god you mean it was some corrupt old white dude all along
Holy shit
What a revelation
Epsilon is looking seriously annoyed now
Really
You guys don’tyou don’t care
At all
Not even a little
Grif yawns so loudly Tucker is pretty sure he hears his jaw crack from across the room
Man if we could give two fucks to rub together over that then Simmons here wouldn’t be a virgin
Simmons bristles
Excuse me
That doesn’t that doesn’t even make any sense
Rubbing fuck Tucker snickers then eyes Wash
I’m into that
Wash
Hey Wash so you know
I’m into that
I heard you Tucker Wash says through gritted teeth
In fact I think everyone heard you
Apparently they didn’t
Epsilon sputters Because if they did then they would care more
Ah um Church I think I know why everyone is confused says Caboose
See you are pronouncing crayon wrong
It’s Charon Caboose
Charon
Charon smaron
Sarge blusters
Aquaman’s right
We don’t give a rat’s ass about the withertoos and the whyfors
All we care about is when we’re gonna get to kick some mercenary ass
Tucker steals a glance at Carolina who has finally overcome her agitation enough to speak
Alright enough
I called you all in here because we need to strategize this is important
Drink Grif says suddenly and everyone on Red Team makes noises of assent and acknowledgement
Carolina stares at him
Drink what does that mean
Oh it’s a super-fun game we invented
Donut says brightly
He’s in the middle of pulling up some sort of chart on his datapad
We keep track of how many times in a day Carolina says ‘this is important’ or ‘enough’ or Wash’s voice cracks or Caboose breaks something et cetera et cetera and then when we have time we take a shot
You can’t actually take shots every time those things happen Tucker scoffs
You’d all be dead
You’re right Grif says because we also take note of how many times you hit on Wash so
Ooh what’s the tally on that
Tucker asks craning his head to see over Simmons’ shoulder
He frowns
Damn
My max is only thirteen pick-up lines a day
I gotta step it up
We don’t always take actual shots Grif says
Sometimes we make a competition out of it like today I think that Wash and Tucker will actually fuck on the training room floor in full view of the entire army
Bonus points if you guess the position
Donut quips
Personally I’ve got my money on cowgirl
Tucker snickers as Wash starts making indignant noises
Can I get in on that action
Enough Carolina says loudly
This
Ocho Lopez notes and all of Red Team marks something down on their datapad
Carolina swells
If you don’t all pay attention
Wait C hang on
I got this
Epsilon looks around the room thoughtfully
I was thinking we’d try to intercept a call between the mercs and the Chairman
How would you guys feel about sticking it to them via a motivational speech
Sarge pauses turning to Epsilon slowly
Well
Go on little junebug
What kind of motivational speech
Alright
Got a little something here that I’ve been working on
Epsilon clears his throat importantly standing up
Dear Chairman It takes the rest of the afternoon to get their speech through to the Chairman
First they have to agree on the actual language of the speech then who would deliver then who would stand in which position for maximum effect
Tucker has a blazing row with Sarge on who gets to stand in front but eventually Tucker wins got-stabbed-by-a-merc trumps Red-team-leader no matter how passionately Sarge argues otherwise
Another hour goes by before they finally manage to lock onto the correct radio code
Tucker has to admit it’s worth it once they get through and cut Felix and Locus off in the middle of their dumb conversation there’s a certain tension in the air a tingling electricity that can be felt over the radio
After Church’s climatic finish ps suck our balls the radio cuts out and they all break into a round of snickering and patting each other on the back
It feels good Tucker thinks and he can’t understand why both Carolina and Wash still look so tense until Carolina clears her throat
There’s something else she says and after several more attempts they all fall quiet
As you all know; I have been scouting around some local storehouses to see if we can find some more ammunition
Yesterday I found some
Tucker straightens at that news unsure of why it makes him feel so uneasy
He had known Carolina and Church were in charge of running recon but actually hearing that they were out there with little to no back-up makes Tucker’s gut twist
He chances a glance at Wash
Wash has his arms folded across his chest and although Tucker can’t see his face he knows it’s wearing a worried frown
Okay Simmons says slowly glancing around the room
The atmosphere is grower tenser by the second
Soso what does that mean
It means we’re gonna go and get them numnuts
Sarge puffs himself up
He holds a hand out to Carolina
Now you just hand over those battle plans little lady and I’ll take care of everything from here
That’s quite alright Sarge Carolina says
I’ll assign the mission directives
Tucker scoffs
Please
Just tell us what to do and we’ll get it done
How is that exactly
We’llI don’t know wing it
Tucker shrugs
It works for us
Like all the time
Carolina exchanges another look with Wash who sighs
We’re not all going Tucker
Tucker frowns
Why not
We can’t Wash hesitates before his voice flattens out
We can’t risk it
Something happening to all of us
It would destroy morale
But ahhhhhhh
Tucker can hear the frown in Caboose’s voice
But ah
Agent Washington we always work together
Because when we split up then you do stupid dramatic things and we have to come rescue you and I don’t want to play that game again
I’d rather play Monopoly instead
Wash sighs
I know buddy
We just
 have to be careful here
How many people are going
Simmons asks
I don’t have many details yet Carolina says
Wash and I will talk it over with Kimball and Doyle and come up with a plan
We’ll update all of you soon
The meeting doesn’t last much longer than that
Before he leaves Tucker glances again at Wash who is already tapping away on his datapad
Probably trying to schedule the whole goddamn mission
Probably well on his way to driving himself crazy
Probably in dire of either a serious fuck or a serious hug
When was the last time someone gave you a hug
He’d asked Wash this once back at Rockslide when he’d walked into the kitchen to see Caboose wrapping Wash up in a big bear hug after what Tucker presumed to be a nightmare
Wash had just frozen his arms going stiff and patting at Caboose’s back
Tucker could tell he’d wanted to push away but he didn’t
I don’t remember Wash had said and it’s only recently that Tucker really understood the gravity of those words
He’s starting to suspect that Wash hadn’t so much as made out with someone in a long long time
He isn’t sure why the idea took so long to occur to him of course Wash wasn’t going to let someone kiss him or touch him or make him lose control
He barely trusted himself most days
Trusting someone else to fuck him
Yeah right
Tucker has his trust though
Tucker knows he does
Wash trusts Tucker to make sure Caboose takes his medicine to have his back during battle to lead a mission and train a squad
He values Tucker’s input doesn’t flinch when their arms brush trusts Tucker to make his coffee perfectly
He trusts Tucker enough to let him hold his helmet in the rain
The trust is there
All Tucker needs to do is show Wash that he can trust him with this too
What Tucker needs is an opportunity
A chance to test things out when they’re not wearing ten billion pounds of armor
Wash is tense and distracted over the next two days constantly checking and rechecking his datapad for god knows what
In fact Tucker can’t help but notice that everyone is a little tense
The knowledge that their first mission since merging armies was not only far sooner than they were prepared for but also vitally important has everyone on edge
Carolina snaps at him through their entire lesson on footwork Palomo starts crying during their session with the cadets and Wash the only time that Wash isn’t staring at a datapad or off into space is during his knife training lessons with Tucker
Which is hot but Tucker can’t lie and say he wouldn’t rather that laser focus be on his hot body instead of the red chalk on said hot body
Wash is all clenched jaws and narrowed eyes as he talks Tucker through several disarming techniques and is utterly unresponsive to any of Tucker’s truly winning come-ons
Which lame
Right when they were actually getting somewhere
When a haunted truly dramatic look comes over Wash’s face after Tucker fumbles a pivot and ends up with chalk all over his neck Tucker can’t take it anymore
Dude do you think I’m gonna die or something
Wash’s stops re-coating the knife with chalk
What did you just say
I mean

Tucker gestures
You’re acting like you’re preparing me for a duel to the death
That’s not funny Wash says sharply
Don’t joke about things like that
Okay okay relax jesus
Look we don’t even know that Felix is going to be at this warehouse with any luck it’ll be a quick in and out job
Bow chi
Wash somehow finds a way to get even tenser
Tucker’s surprised his muscles haven’t snapped under the strain
We can’t rely on that Tucker
Luck doesn’t last forever
We have to be prepared for every possible outcome
This isn’t the time to be flippant
Hey
Stop yelling at me
I’m not yelling
Yes you fucking are
You know I can’t fucking concentrate when you do that
Well I can’t concentrate when you start making jokes about people dying on missions
Why you find that funny
I never said it was funny
They’re both cross and irritable during the rest of their training session and Tucker watches Wash leave the room with a sigh
If he knows Wash he’s off to further brood
Tucker weighs the pros and cons of following Wash so he can blow him in the shower orgasms are the perfect cure for tension but ultimately decides that he needs to be a touch subtler
Jesus Christ he’s never worked so hard to get laid in all his life
Wash is forcing him to pull out all the stops but in a way it’s kind of exciting
Tucker’s never been able to wait out a slow burn before but for once he is convinced that the payoff will be more than worth it
So Tucker lets Wash stalk off and spends his own shower time rubbing one out to ease his own tension
If he can’t actually blow Wash in the showers he’s sure going to imagine the fuck out of it and if there’s one thing Tucker can say for himself it’s that he has a very active imagination
He doesn’t see Wash for the rest of the day
Tucker had pulled the shitty late-night guard duty shift with Ali and the two of them wandered the perimeter for a while until Bitters and Britton came to relieve them
He frowns when he gets back to his own hallway- Wash’s door is open and a quick peek inside proves that Wash is nowhere to be seen
Tucker unsnaps all of his own armor and wanders the base for a while and is unsurprised when he walks past the meeting room on his way back and finds Wash sitting at the table
He has three guns on set out neatly next to him but his armor is nowhere to be seen
That’s even worse than him still being in it because it means he went to his room tried to sleep and came back here
Dude seriously
Wash glances up
Oh good
Can I get your opinion on something
I mean sure but can it wait until morning
What
Wash asks absently shuffling some more papers around
Tucker sighs resigned and takes a seat across from Wash
The cranky tension from their earlier bickering is gone at least and the faster he humors Wash the faster they can all go the fuck to sleep
Preferably together
Okay
What’s so vitally important that it can’t wait until morning
These numbers Wash says
From the intel Carolina gathered on the guns
They don’t make any sense
A warehouse this size there has to be more than just a couple dozen boxes of ammunition
So Tucker frowns
What you think there’s more ammunition
That’s good right
Maybe Wash says more ammunition or something else in that warehouse
The numbersthey look deliberately fudged
Maybe they fudged them on purpose
I suppose they could have Wash says slowly but why
How did they know we’d retrieve this data
Just a precaution
A precaution Wash says or a trap
Great
Just what they need
So you’re saying we need more intel
I’m saying I think we also need to restructure this whole mission
More backup and entering slowly two by two instead of a whole force
We need to scope out the situation before charging in there
Wash is frowning heavily at the papers and Tucker looks at him suspiciously
Dude have you left this room for more than two seconds all day
Hmm
Wash throws him a half glance
What
No of course not this mission is in a week and we can’t send people in there with this intel
I’m not disagreeing with you but you gotta take a break
You’re gonna drive yourself crazy
I’m fine
Wash
Go to bed
In a bit Wash mutters in that same distracted tone and Tucker would bet his super badass sword that if left to his own devices Wash would still be sitting at this damn table come dawn
Which is quite frankly unacceptable
Well no better time to test things out
Tucker gets up to wander around the other side of the desk as if he can’t see properly and leans over Wash’s shoulder
I still don’t get where you got these numbers from
Look right here
At this chart I drew up
The numbers don’t add up see
A warehouse this size there should be way more guards here
Tucker does see and it’s a good point one that they’re going to have to discuss but right now he’s far more distracted by the fact that Wash hadn’t even flinched when Tucker walked up behind him
Wash hates people looming over him or standing out of his line of sight; they can’t go anywhere without Wash checking the exits and making sure his back is to the wall
Now though
Wash’s shoulders are loose the lines of tension in his body only from the stress of the upcoming mission not Tucker’s proximity
He’s still completely absorbed in the plans and Tucker tries to remember if Wash has always been this at ease with Tucker at his back
They fight well together in the field and he recalls several tense moments when he’s fought his way out of a situation with Wash’s back pressed tightly to his own but thishad they always been like this
Comfortable
Easy
Safe
He’s so thrown by Wash’s non-reaction that his carefully chosen extremely subtle words
I can think of something more exciting to do if we’re gonna be staying up so late die in his throat
This might call for Plan B
Tucker
Wash asks somewhat absently and Tucker realizes he’s been standing there staring at the back of Wash’s head
Probably a good thing Wash can’t see him
Do you see what I mean
I think so you mean here
He leans closer chest just brushing against Wash’s shoulder
Wash pauses his hand stilling from where it was scribbling numbers on a piece of paper before resuming
That’s right he says calmly and although his voice doesn’t stutter he has gone very still as if making a concerted effort to not pull away from Tucker’s touch
A little more then
Hmmm
Tucker leans closer still so that his lips are merely centimeters away from Wash’s ear
Casually
Coincidentally
You think we need more people for the mission
There
Right there
Wash’s fingers noticeably tighten on the pencil as Tucker’s breath ghosts across his neck
Yes he says voice almost too steady as if he’s forcing it to stay calm
I believe so
Okay Tucker says and he sighs long and low in Wash’s ear relishing in the way Wash fidgets ever so slightly in his seat
Okay great
Yeah Wash says
Yeah
Tucker grins and with another sigh he pulls back resting his hands on Wash’s shoulders
Wash jolts a little but he doesn’t stiffen more surprised than uncomfortable Tucker thinks
He digs his thumbs into the knots of muscles bunched up in Wash’s shoulders and gets to work on kneading away the tension
Okay so let’s do that then
Gather some more intel and up the numbers for the mission
Right Wash says slowly
Right we’ll
Tucker what are you doing
Tucker rolls his eyes
Wash will remain half oblivious when Tucker practically starts necking him but now he’s on high alert
I’m giving you a massage dude what does it feel like I’m doing
Oh Wash says
Um why
Because you’re tense as fuck
And he is almost worryingly so
Seriously you need to relax
There’s no way you aren’t sore from walking around like this all day
I’m fine Wash says stiffly
Tucker resists the urge to throttle him
Kay
Whatever you say
I’m still gonna give you a massage
You don’tyou don’t have to do that
Well I want to how ‘bout that
Tucker sighs
Wash relax
I mean you know I’m not gonna hurt you right
I know Wash says surprised and he half turns around to look at Tucker
I know that
I just Does it not feel good
Tucker asks then can’t resist adding I can go harder if you want
Bowchickabowwow
Itno it feels good Wash says slowly like it’s a problem and Tucker realizes all at once what the issue is that it does feel good and therefore Wash thinks he can’t have it
Wash is still half-craning his head to look at him
Tucker slides a hand up through Wash’s hair making a gentle fist at the roots and tugging firm and slow until Wash’s head is resting back against Tucker’s shoulder his gaze directed up at the ceiling
Wash
Relax he murmurs right into the crook of Wash’s neck
Just relax
Come on
Put the pencil down
Tucker’s not sure if it’s his words or his tone or the hand in his hair but Wash does
He does
The pencil falls from his hand almost of its own accord his hands limply coming to rest on the table
Tucker runs his fingers through Wash’s hair giving it another authoritative pull before directing Wash’s gaze forward once more
Tucker straightens moves both hands back to Wash’s shoulders and digs in much more firmly this time and he knows he got the pressure right when Wash gasps
He kneads Wash’s shoulders harder still making sure to pay attention to his arms and the back of his neck as well
Tucker’s careful not to stray too close to his implants but he isn’t even sure if Wash would notice if he did touch them
Wash keeps sighing little hums of pleasure escaping his throat and when he sways slightly in his seat Tucker pushes him gently forward
Wash doesn’t protest this time resting his hands on his forearms as Tucker moves to massaging his back
Feel better
Mmmhmm Wash sighs and he lays there Tucker rubbing large circles on either side of his spine
He’s utterly still until Tucker’s hands ghost along his sides right under his ribs and he jumps exhaling a shaky laugh
Tucker freezes for a moment before grinning
You ticklish Wash
Hah Wash pauses thoughtfully
I uh
I’m not sure actually
Wash’s tone is neither morose nor pitying it is only a simple statement of fact but somehow that’s even worse
Tucker knows Wash is fucked up
He knows Wash has nightmares has seen him after nightmares he knows Wash doesn’t sleep and has panic attacks and memory issues and trust issues and probably intimacy issues but this this Wash not knowing if he’s ticklish or not because he doesn’t remember because it’s probably been so long 
It floors Tucker
He clenches his jaw before laughing a little and dropping his forehead into the nook between Wash’s shoulder blades for a moment
Okay he says
Okay dude
Well let’s find out
He flutters his fingers right along Wash’s sides and Wash jumps
The laughter peals out of him in a startled burst and he squirms away batting at Tucker’s arms
Tucker beams delighted and moves his fingers to dance along Wash’s stomach until Wash curls over laughing to grab at Tucker’s hands
Stop he gasps
Stop
Not fair
Oh my god Tucker snickers
Wash still has their hands tangled together by his stomach and Tucker likes the way it draws his arms around Wash in a protective embrace
Oh I am so gonna use that against you in training
You can’t
Wash protests
That’s cheating
Hey you’re always telling me to use whatever advantage I can in training
Is that or is that not an advantage
It’s not a fair one Wash grumps and then the laughter is pealing out of him again as Tucker blows a raspberry right into the crook of his neck
Tucker
Alright alright Tucker straightens glad Wash can’t see the stupid moony grin on his face and puts his hands back on Wash’s shoulders
I’ll stop I swear
You will not Wash huffs but he lets Tucker continue to massage his shoulders
Before long his head has drifted back to the table of its own accord
Tucker works the tension out of his arms his neck his back and Wash’s eyes flutter closed
Tucker’s had some pretty awesome sexual experiences over the years
Like truly word-class record-breaking kind of shit
Yet this right here is hands down the most sensual moment of his whole goddamn life
Wash melting into his hands as Tucker kneads the tension out of his bones little sighs and moans punching out of him
He realizes with a thrill of excitement that he could do anything he wanted right now and Wash would let him would with the right amount of coaxing probably even beg him
Tucker’s halfway hard because really Wash just keeps making noises that would drive anyone out of their mind and Tucker would be lying if he said he wasn’t thinking about bending Wash right over this table and fucking him until they both saw God
It’s this knowledge that he could do whatever he wanted to Wash that keeps him from doing it
Wash is half-asleep half-delirious with endorphins and oxytocin and even though he’s not actually drugged up Tucker can’t help but feel that he’d be taking advantage somehow
So he doesn’t
For now he doesn’t want to do anything to ruin this gentle fragile trust that Wash has placed in him
He wants to keep it safe cup it in his hands like water
He stays there running his hands through Wash’s hair until Wash is limp and heavy and asleep right there on the conference table
They stay like that for over an hour
Tucker’s own back is starting to get sore and he knows that he should try to get Wash into an actual bed but every time he moves to wake Wash up he just can’t do it
He’s sleeping actually sleeping his face slack and smushed up against his crossed forearms
Dude you’re so fucked Grif had told him flatly during training and Tucker sighs at the memory
He is
He so is
What the fuck are you doing
Tucker glances up sharply to see Carolina standing in the doorway Epsilon hovering over her shoulder
They both have their arms crossed over their shoulders helmets titled in disapproval
Jesus
You’d think they’d have been partnered up their whole life as opposed to a handful of months
What the fuck does it look like Church
I’m giving Wash a massage
You want one too
Funny Epsilon grumps
That’s that’s funny Tucker
Don’t start Tucker warns
You said you were cool with it so don’t start
And keep your goddamn voices down you’ll wake him up
Carolina gives Epsilon a sideways glance before turning back to Tucker
You should both be asleep
In actual beds
Beds plural Epsilon can’t resist adding
They ignore him
Tucker gives Carolina a pointed look
Yeah so should you
At least we’re out of armor
What the fuck are you doing anyway
Just checking the perimeter Carolina says
Fucking shameless she is
Oh-ho
And it’s your turn to stand watch is it
Well
Don’t bother I know it’s not Tucker says rolling his eyes
We’re going alright
Epsilon fidgets before blurting He’s ticklish
On his sides
You’ll wake him if you if you yeah
He’s ticklish
Yeah Tucker says
Yeah I know Church
Epsilon jerks his head back a little surprised before clearing his throat
Oh
Well
Okay then
Wash is starting to stir beneath Tucker’s hands
He mouths a fierce GO towards Carolina and Church and after some more unnecessary dramatic glances in Wash’s direction from Epsilon they go
Tucker sighs as Wash wakes up even more humming and stretching and lifting his head slightly off the table
Tucker keeps rubbing up and down his spine before leaning down and brushing his lips over the top of Wash’s head
Hey
C’mon
Let’s go to bed
M’fine here Wash says and Tucker smiles before reluctantly trailing his hands off of Wash’s back
He leans down tugging on Wash’s arm to pull him to a stand
Wash blinks at him sleepily running a hand through his hair and rumpling it up even further
Tucker gathers up Wash’s guns and gestures with his head towards the door
C’mon let’s go
The walk back to their hallway is sleepy and quiet Wash yawning hugely all the while
Tucker lays the guns out on the crate next to his bedside table bullets left only in the battle rifle tucked under his bed the way he’s seen Wash doing a million times and when he straightens Wash is leaning in the doorway watching him fondly
Thanks Wash says as Tucker heads past him back into the hallway
Thanks
You didn’thave to do that
I know Tucker says and he brushes Wash’s shoulder a little
I wanted to dude
Now go the fuck to sleep
Wash smiles at him and before Tucker can make heads or tails of the situation he reaches out a hesitant hand to brush some of Tucker’s dreads behind his shoulder
Thanks he mutters again then quickly backs into his room leaving Tucker in the middle of the hallway positively beaming
So s’then Church is all oh Tuck
Tucker be careful he’s ticklish
Be careful Tucker
He’s tick-lish
Tucker drains the rest of his beer in one agitated gulp before slamming it back down onto the bar and turning to Grif in despair
I mean like what the fuck doesee think I’m gonna do
Tickle him to death
Grif pauses in his desperate attempts to flag down the bartender to throw Tucker an unimpressed look
Dude come on
How much have you had to drink
Not enough Tucker grumbles
They have both been here for several hours they’d high-tailed it out of the base less than five minutes after Tucker had cornered Grif during dinner and told him he needed a serious drink
Tucker had spent the entire day unable to fully process what had happened between him and Wash in the conference room
He’d felt a sudden wave of affection for Grif when he’d only gone for seconds of mashed potatoes not third and marched right out with Tucker to the bar that they’d all discovered during Operation Watermelon
This affection has only multiplied after four beers and three shots of whiskey
Grif eyes him in alarm as Tucker slaps a hand on his shoulder
Grif Tucker says
You’re such a succhhhagoo friend
Bartender
Grif waves his arm desperately at the bartender as she breezes by
Bartender
I need an alcohol
Please
The bartender pauses in the midst of juggling several bottles
What kind of alcohol
Any alcohol
Me too
Tucker yells after her
An an alcohol pleeesss and thank you
No Grif says alarmed No he does not need
The bartender is already gone to find them some alcohol
That’s nice
She’s so nice
Shook his hand and called him Captain and everything
I could’ve fucked him Tucker says solemnly during the lull that follows the bartender’s absence
I could’ve done it Grif
Could’ve fucked him right there on the table
Please kill me Grif says to the ceiling
Wash Tucker clarifies
Just in case Grif was confused
I coulda fucked Wash
Yeah I got that Tucker
It’s all you’ve been saying for the last three hours
M’serious Grif
He was all all relaxed and soft and and melty
He was melty Grif
Tucker slaps his hand back on Grif’s shoulder and drags it down his arm
Melty like like that
Thank god Grif mutters as their drinks arrive
He downs half of his in one gulp makes a face and slams it back on the bar
Eh
Not bad
Why Grif
Tucker asks staring into his drink
Why why didn’t I fuck him
Probably because you’re whipped
Hey
Tucker exclaims frowning
Hey
Thasnotthasnot true
What jus’ ‘cause I wannawanna make him feel good it means I’m whipped
Grif scrubs his hands over his face before peering at Tucker through his fingers
I mean dude
I still don’t understand when this even happened
You did nothing but complain about him after the crash
This was like zero to one hundred
I feel like I have whiplash
I missed him Tucker says and even though he’s drunk off his ass he still can’t quite look at Grif while he says it
I fucking missed him
When he was with the Feds
I miss’d Sarge and Donut too he shoots a glance at Grif Don’t tell them that bubut Wash it was likeit hurt
It hurt in here
Tucker slams a hand over his chest to demonstrate and Grif sighs
He’s silent for a while before he says Yeah
You did
You missed him a lot
He side-eyes Tucker
You were really fucking annoying about it too
Lissen Grif
Lissen
Tucker wrenches his bar stool around until he’s facing Grif who casts a despairing glance to the ceiling
I am so good at making people feelgood
Ya know
N’WashWash should feel good
Hehe jus he hates himself ya know
I’ll give you that
Tucker nods encouraged
Right
‘S’like’s’like

I mean I wanna fuck him so good like justjust suck his dick and make him go crazy
Grif groans resting his forehead on the bar with a clunk
God Tucker stop
Please
I will literally pay you to stop talking about sucking Wash’s dick
I do not want that mental image in my head
Why
Tucker asks and when Grif doesn’t answer he paws ineffectually at Grif’s shoulder
Grif why
Who wouldn’t want that in their head
S’all I can think about
Grif snaps his head up and downs the rest of his drink
Another alcohol bartender
Oh
Right
Alcohol
Tucker fumbles a little with his drink before taking a sip and immediately gagging
Fuck
What the fuck is this
Don’t know don’t care Grif says and snatches Tucker’s drink out of his hand
Tucker blinks as he finishes it then shrugs and continues
So anyway
I wanna fuck Wash like that is a fact but
 but I also just
I just wanna hold him
Y’know
Jus’ hold him
And rub his back
N’ his hair
Grif his hair his hair is so soft
So soft
Grif groans before turning to Tucker
Dude just jus’ make a move already ya know
Fuck it
For the first time Tucker notices that his voice is slurring a little as well and he puts a hand on Grif’s forearm
I know
I know dude
But this isn’tisn’t some fling y’know
It’sit’s Wash
I need all my best moves
It’s gotta it’s gotta be right
Grif widens his eyes tugging the drinks the bartender sets down a little closer
You love him
I Tucker pauses considering
Ifuck man I don’t know
I mean I meanI’ve hardly thought of anyone else when I jerked off in liketwo weeks
Like three quarters of what gesssme off these days is Wash
Izzat love
I ‘unno man
I just don’t know
Soso what you gonna like date him
I justwanna be there for him
Like hold him after a nightmare y’know
You mean a nightmare like the one I’ve been having during this whole conversation
Grif mumbles but Tucker can tell he’s full of shit
You’re full of shit he tells Grif and pats his shoulder affectionately
Whatever Grif grunts
Justjus’ make a move already
Okay
I can’t deal with you making puppy eyes at him for another goddamn sec’n
Well doesn’t this look fun
They both turn to see Donut standing behind their bar stools
Donut
Tucker exclaims and slaps a hand on his shoulder as well
Have a drink with us
Donut eyes him then eyes Grif then eyes the stack of glasses on the bar next to him
Well now that’s quite a lot of alcohol
Don’t judge me Grif mutters
You’d need a lot of alcohol too if you had to listen to Tucker talk about fucking Wash for the last three hours
Donut huffs
Alright listen up
Simmons and I have been covering for you two all evening and wait
You’re talking about Wash
Oh god
Well in that case Donut drags a bar stool over and sets it behind them clambering on
Do tell
I jus
I just
Tucker takes a deep breath as Grif rests his forehead on the bar
I just
He gave Wash some stupid massage in the meeting room and didn’t fuck him even though he could have it just didn’t seem right he needs all his best moves he just wants to hold Wash and make him feel good in every godddamn sense of the word and also he wants to pet Wash’s hair like a weirdo
He lifts his head slightly to glare at Tucker
Did I get it all
Verrry funny Grif Tucker grumps and startles as Donut clasps his hands solemnly
Tucker you have to tell Wash all of that
Tucker shakes his head impatiently
Donut
Donut
I need my best moves here
I need toto finesse
The suit-ation requires finesse
Donut is looking rather pained
Butbut don’t you think you should just sit down and talk to him about it
Like talk about your feelings
Nono trust me
Tucker
Trust me
I really really think you should talk to him
Finesse Donut
Fin-esse
Donut groans and leans between them towards the bartender
Shanelle
The bartender turns
Franklin
A glass of merlot
Yes please
He turns to Tucker with a sigh
I think I’m gonna need it
Wash steps back to observe the obstacle course he’s just finished setting up with a critical eye
It’s good he notes challenging without being disheartening
Some obstacles require strength some dexterity and almost all of them require teamwork to get through
And that right there is the problem
Individually the Federalist and New Republic soldiers have improved remarkably in the past weeks
Kimball and Doyle have both thanked him several times over for his efforts although Wash isn’t sure how much he deserves it
He has by no means worked miracles he has simply given the News some structure and shown the Feds a thing or two about improving their accuracy
Playing to his strengths just like Carolina had suggested
None of this is going to help him figure out how to get two groups of people who hate each other to work together
How he’s supposed to pull that off when he himself has absolutely no social graces is a mystery
This should be a task for a normal happy person not a paranoid ex-spec ops soldier who turns into an emotional wreck at the mere suggestion of a simple wine and cheese night with friends
That’s not even taking into account the utter mess he’s making out of this crush he has on Tucker
No
He can’t think about Tucker or the way his hands had felt on Wash’s shoulders or the way his smile simultaneously turned Wash’s legs to jelly and made him want to turn Tucker’s own legs to jelly
Focus
He needs to focus
He needs to figure out how to make these two armies connect how to turn enemies into friends
Friends
The solution that comes to him is so simple so obvious that he isn’t sure how it took him this long to see it
A slow grins spreads across his face as the idea blossoms
Wash is no good at making friends but he knows someone who is someone who declared Wash his friend without a second thought despite having every reason to hate him
Wash thumbs through to the text-reader on his HUD and fires off a message
WSH
Hey buddy
I could use your help with a training exercise in about an hour
Are you free
Ten minutes later Caboose comes thundering into the training room
His arms are full of various pieces of armor that he hasn’t finished putting on yet and his chest plate is askew
Agent Washington he yells slamming the door behind him
I came as fast as I could
Thanks Caboose although you didn’t have to rush Wash reaches out to straighten Caboose’s chest plate and stops him from sealing one of his shoulder pieces
No no that one goes on the other arm
He finishes snapping the rest of Caboose’s armor on not an easy task as Caboose continues to bounce around excitedly
What are we doing today
I’m training the two armies together for the first time today
Wash gestures at the course in front of them
As you can see I’ve set up an obstacle course for them to run
Caboose wait
Yelling proves futile as Caboose is already well in the midst of the course vaulting over a wall that Wash was certain would take two people to clear
I like this game
Wash sighs resigned but watches in fond amazement as Caboose completes the course with hardly any difficulty at all
He clears the last obstacle and skids to a halt in front of Wash breathing only slightly heavier than normal
How did I do
Did I win
You didwell that wasfrankly amazing Caboose but you didn’t need to run it
I’m going to have the Feds and the New run it
I want them to work together
You may have noticed that theydon’t like each other much
Hmm Caboose pauses thoughtfully
Yeah see I just think that’s very silly
Because Andersmith likes chocolate and Fitz likes chocolate and you would think that they would look at each other and say oh
We both like something
Let’s share and be friends
But they don’t
It’s very confusing
Exactly Caboose exactly
That’s where you come in
Me
Yes
I was hoping that you could help them all become friends today
Wash pauses
You know
Help them work together
Well of course Wash
Caboose beams at him and though he can’t see it through the helmet Wash can tell
He always can
But aah
Why do you need my help with that
Because you’rewell
You’re very good at making friends
Caboose nods wisely
Yes I am
But so are you
Wash snorts before he can stop himself
That’snice of you to say Caboose but I’m really not
Of course you are
You do all the things that good friends do
You help me with my armor and you help Tucker not be afraid of sharp things and you help Carolina dye her hair and that one time I was sick you stayed by my bed for two days and you always let Grif pick his protein bar first because he is the pickiest and will not eat the vanilla flavored ones and all of the cadets say you helped them watch The Grey Skeleton and those are all things that good friends do
Wash stares at him for several seconds before he’s able to find his words
Wellwell Caboose clasps his hand solemnly between his own
Wash you are a very good friend
You are one of my best friends
I tell everyone that
All the time
Thanks Caboose Wash stutters and he pats Caboose’s shoulder awkwardly with his free hand
Thensince you and I areare good friends we should lead by example
Help them work through this obstacle course together
Okay
Caboose gestures towards the course
That was very fun Wash
I think they will all enjoy it
Wash somehow doubts that
Do you want to try to run it together
It is fun running the course with Caboose
Caboose slows down with Wash next to him and a few obstacles in Wash sees him start to understand the teamwork that most require to get through the course
He lets Wash help him at moments where Wash is certain he doesn’t need it and always seems to offer a hand to Wash at just the right moment
Caboose’s good mood is infectious and by the time they finish the course Wash has laughed more than he has in weeks
It’s this right here that Wash is hoping will help snap the armies into shape
Caboose’s strength and laughter and that light that always seems to reach into even the darkest of places
The soldiers from both armies arrive in little groups and station themselves at opposite ends of the room glaring mistrustfully at each other
Wash stands in the middle arms folded watching as Caboose bounds from group to group completely oblivious to the tension seeping into the room
The soldiers brighten as Caboose approaches them but fall back into sulking as he flits to the next group
Wash can’t imagine what the atmosphere would bel like if Caboose wasn’t here at all
Attention
Wash calls once they’ve all filed in and they snap to
He briefly considers lecturing them on the importance of behaving particularly when they have such an important mission coming up but decides that the best thing to do would be to act like this is just another normal training session
As you can see here I’ve constructed an elaborate obstacle course designed to test your strength reflexes and teamwork
You will need a partner to complete this exercise andyes Ali
Will this exercise be timed sir
It will not be timed
The important part is
Do we get to pick our partners
Martinez interrupts and all the Feds instantly start puffing themselves up
Interrupting a commanding officer one of them mutters just loud enough for her voice to carry
No respect at all
Um you know we can hear you right
Britton says loudly
Yes you can pick your own partners Wash says choosing to ignore the mutinous muttering
But
He sighs as the cadets all instantly start inching towards each other
But you have to pick someone from the opposite side of the room
Opposite side of the room
Not opposite army
Wash takes a moment to mentally pat himself on the back for this subtle distinction but his moment of happy congratulation quickly ends as half the cadets start whining
Quiet he snaps and they fall into a sulky silence
Alright listen up
You are going to work together whether you like it or not
I don’t care if we have to stay here all night
No one leaves until every single person has completed this course successfully with a partner
Is that understood
Sir yes sir comes the response
Wash chooses to ignore the low and furious tone
I’m sure you are all aware of the mission we have coming up
Some of you will be assigned to go on that mission
It should go without saying that only the soldiers who have proven that they take all parts of the training seriously including teamwork will be assigned to any missions of importance
Is that understood
Sir yes sir Good
Now partner up
The two groups start shuffling reluctantly towards each other
It takes some cajoling and maneuvering from Wash but after the third group he sends to run laps along the perimeter of the room for lack of cooperation they lose the stubbornness
Wash sets pairs to run the obstacle course at staggered intervals and while there is no immediate violence there is plenty of bickering going on throughout the room
Wash throws a half-glance at Caboose who to Wash’s dismay has stopped paying attention and is now playing a game on his datapad
Caboose
Hmmmm
Caboose says
Wash closes his eyes briefly
Caboose I need you to help me keep an eye on everyone
Oh says Caboose his voice carrying without intent
Oh okay
See it’s just that everyone is being very mean to each other and it’s making me sad and I don’t like to be sad soooo
Wash eyes the room in interest as those standing nearby shift guiltily
I know buddy he mutters low enough for only Caboose to hear
Justjust try to get through to them
Caboose sighs loudly before snapping his datapad back into its slot on his armor
Okay but only because you asked nicely Wash
Caboose bounds off to the nearest pair of cadets which happen to be Britton and her Federalist partner Sabine don’t know why you have to be such a mean snooty bitch Britton is saying viciously
I’m telling you if you boost me up and then take my hand
Sabine snorts
As if a little twig like you is going to be able to haul me over that wall
Britton swells but before she can get another word in Caboose has sandwiched his way between the two soldiers and has thrown an arm around them both
Oh
Oh Sabine
Did you see the episode of Anatomy Grey last night
Because I think that the new nurse is the great great great great great great granddaughter of
Wait Britton interrupts her visor snapping towards Sabine
You watch Grey’s Anatomy
Really
So what if I do
Sabine asks suspiciously then startles as Britton grasps her hand her entire demeanor changing
Oh
Oh
What do you think of the new doctor
I think he is not quite who he appears to be Caboose says wisely
Sabine hesitates glancing between Caboose and Britton
Wellwell okay so this is my theory Wash shakes his head as the two of them chatter their way through the obstacle course Caboose mysteriously vanishing
He turns his eyes to the rest of the room most of whom aren’t finding common ground quite so easily
He hastens to break up a scuffle between Prajapati and one of the Feds and ends up having to send them off for another five laps before they can return to training
It takes nearly twenty minutes to get the two of them to complete a single obstacle successfully and by the time he backs away exhausted but pleased it’s to find that Caboose has encouraged cooperation between half a dozen pairs of soldiers in the time it took Wash to wrangle one
The afternoon drags on and on but miraculously by the end of it everyone has completed the obstacle course and is reasonably intact
Well done he says ignoring the incredulous stares
Same time tomorrow at the firing range
Dismissed
Caboose moves to bound off after them and Caboose snags his arm
Wait Caboose he clears his throat
Thanks
You’re welcome Agent Washington
Caboose says and after a bone-crushing hug he grabs Wash’s wrist and starts tugging him out the door
Let’s go eat lunch
Wash follows without much resistance
They have after all earned it
The task of getting the two armies to work together is by no means over
Wash knows that they have taken a very small step on what will be a long tiresome and likely disheartening journey
It is still a step
They took a step
Wash took a step and thinking back on the training session he isn’t sure he could’ve done it alone
Caboose had been a godsend had come when Wash asked and had taken that step right by his side
It had felt good Wash notes with surprise
Good to move forward with someone you trust standing next to him
To ask for their help and have them grant it without a second thought
To not go it alone
Maybe maybe he doesn’t have to go everything alone
Wash fidgets outside of Dr Grey’s office door that evening
He’s already half-regretting his decision to come talk to her but after Tucker had got him all flustered and wound up in another training session today he had jerked off again this afternoon
Tucker hadn’t even really done anything except smile and let his touches linger a few seconds too long but Wash was finding it increasingly difficult to be around him sans armor ever since Tucker had given him that massage in the meeting room
Tucker’s hands on his back and in his hair had felt good so good and all Wash wants is more
There is still a part of him that says he shouldn’t want more
Tucker is still too good for him and Wash is still a mess but he had fallen asleep in a foreign environment right there under Tucker’s touch and he hadn’t woken up violently
It’s not everything but it’s certainly not nothing
But he could slip up at any time
Wash knows this
He may not have woken up and hurt Tucker but he could
That’s a serious issue in and of itself without even taking into account the fact that Wash hasn’t had sex in at least five years
Not only would he probably make a complete fool out of himself but Wash has no idea what’s going on with his body
He’s gotten hard several times in the past few days after years of thinking his sex drive completely gone and while it is a welcome change he can’t help but feel seriously unnerved
If he’s going to do this if he’s even thinking about doing this then he needs to get some answers
Wash spends several more minutes raising his hand to knock then letting it fall trying to find some nerve
In what he will later be sure is a sudden burst of insanity he raps twice on Dr Grey’s door slams it open and blurts I’ve jerked off three times in the past five days
He doesn’t understand so he blinks
Once
Twice
His brain goes offline because that’s definitely Dr Grey wearing something red and lacy and that’s definitely Sarge wearing nothing but a lab coat and surgical goggles and Wash is definitely going to have nightmares about this for the rest of his life particularly when Sarge glances him up at him from his position between Dr Grey’s legs and says That’s a hell of a way to ask someone for a threesome Agent Washington
Wash gapes for an entirely inappropriate amount of time because his brain and his voice and his feet aren't responding
He finally wrenches one foot off the ground and does an about-face stumbling out of the door
Oh don’t leave we weren’t saying no
Dr Grey calls after him and Wash thinks if his face gets any hotter he might actually keel over and die
He just might welcome it
He continues marching robotically through the halls until he finds a quiet bench where he can sit down and stare at a wall and desperately try to wipe those images from his mind
It dawns on him in horrific clarity that with his memory in pretty good working order these days he will now have to live with the knowledge of what Sarge looks like naked and wonder where the hell Dr Grey got lingerie in a war zone
Twenty minutes later he barely registers footsteps making their way down the hall
To his horror Dr Grey is sitting down on the bench next to him
Oh god Wash says
No
No
Just go finish what you were doing
Leave me here to die
I did finish Dr Grey says primly clasping her hands atop her crossed legs
Several times actually
The Colonel is quite gifted with his tongue
Oh my god Wash says and moves to stand
Okay I’m just gonna
Dr Grey latches onto his arm and yanks him back down hard
Oh no you don’t
You sit your perky little butt right back down here and you tell me what was so important that you barged into my office at this hour without knocking
I did knock Wash moans
I did
I’m sorry I should’ve that was god
Dr Grey waves a hand
Oh it’s fine
I suppose you did announce your arrival and I could’ve locked the door butwell
The Colonel and I do both enjoy a little danger
Please stop calling him ‘the Colonel
’ Please
Oh stop
Now
Dr Grey straightens and beams at him
Go on and tell me all about your masturbatory issues
I assume you came to me because you seek medical advice
Wash casts a despairing glance up at the ceiling before sighing resigned to his fate
Wellyes
I’velately I’ve felt Sexually aroused
Dr Grey supplies and Wash nods
Judging by that sorrowful look at your face I take it that this is a problem
It’s not a problem Wash says slowly
It’s just been a long time since I’ve feltthat way
Well you have had a stressful few months
Years
I’m talking years
Since Project Freelancer
Dr Grey is silent for a few moments
And the tipping point was the experience with your artificial intelligence unit I take it
Yeah Wash says then frowns
How did you She taps gently on the side of his skull
I performed brain surgery on you silly
That is why you came to me with this isn’t it
Yes I justI didn’t know how much you could tell just from looking
Enough she says her voice losing a bit of its brightness
Those shiny little wires told me enough
I just Wash says staring down at his hands
I thought there was brain damage
There is she says quietly and he jerks his head up to look at her
There is quite a significant amount of brain damage particularly to your memory centers
But you already know that don’t you
He laughs bitterly
Yeah
I know that
Dr Grey tilts her head at him
Why do you think this affected your ability to perform sexually
Because I haven’t been sexually active since before thatincident
He frowns when she continues to look confused
I’m not just talking about sex with someone else
I couldn’t even get

An erection
Yes
Not until recently
And you thought this was a result of brain damage caused by you AI
It’s the only explanation isn’t it
Dr Grey is silent for a while her face thoughtful
These erections
What caused them
Wash can feel his face turning bright red and after several aborted attempts he finds himself unable to answer
For some reason his discomfort only adds to Dr Grey’s confidence
It’s a specific person isn’t it
That you feel a sexual attraction to
Wellyes Wash says choosing to ignore the knowing look on her face
Hmmm
Dr Grey taps a finger against her chin
This person
How does he make you feel
Wash ignores the pronoun as well
II don’t know a lot of things
Does he make you feel safe
Wash pauses
Thinks of Tucker holding his helmet running a hand through his hair pressing their backs together in a firefight
Yes he says
Surprised
Yes
He does
Dr Grey smiles at him slightly
Wash I don’t think there was any physical damage to your sex drive
You don’t
No
I think that for you sexual intimacy is very much wrapped up in feelings of safety and trust
Her smile turns sad
And I think it’s been a very very long time since you’ve truly felt safe
Wash can’t look at her
There’s something tightening in his chest curling in on itself
It doesn’t matter he says stiffly
It doesn’t matter how I feel about it
I can’tit’s too dangerous for me to be with someone
Why
He throws up his hands agitated
Why does everyone keep saying that
Dr Grey huffs
Now you just calm right back down
Why does everyone keep saying what
Everyone keeps acting likelike it doesn’t matter that I have violent nightmares
Like it’s no big deal
Like I didn’tdidn’t almost kill Tucker when we first met because he tried to wake me up
I may bebetter I guess
I don’t know but I’m stillI’m still a mess
I could seriously hurt him
Wash
I wouldn’t survive that he says hollowly
I would never forgive myself if I hurt him
In any way
Tucker deserves someone better someone whowho he doesn’t have to worry about waking up swinging
Someone who actually knows how to make him feel good he buries his face in his hands and groans
I don’t even know what I’m doing anymore
Alright that’s enough Dr Grey says firmly and tugs his hands away from his face
Goodness me you are melodramatic aren’t you
It’s not funny he growls and she rolls her eyes
Oh stop
Now you listen here
No one is denying the fact that there are certain roadblocks to you becoming intimate with someone but you are remarkably aware of them
You are aware of your nightmares and the issues you have with trust and vulnerability
So what
You’re saying I should just give it a try
Dr Grey tugs his hand into her lap and gives it a little pat before curling her fingers around his
That’s exactly what I’m saying silly
He shakes his head a little
It can’t be that easy
She huffs
Well of course not because you complicate everything
You don’t have to do anything you don’t want to butif you want thisif you want Tuckerthen I think you should just try
I don’t know how to do this he mutters and she squeezes his hand before standing
None of us do silly
That’s why we need someone
To figure it out together
She starts to walk down the hallway but pauses before she gets too far
Come see me anytime Wash
Doctor to patient or friend to friend
Okay he says
Okay
Andthanks Dr Grey
Emily
She winks at him
People who have seen me naked get to call me Emily
He groans up at the ceiling but feels a smile tugging at the corners of his mouth nonetheless
Thank you Emily
You’re quite welcome Wash
And she’s gone leaving Wash to sit on the bench for a little longer to turn over her words and of Tucker and of the soft warm thing fluttering inside his chest that just might be hope
Wash doesn’t do anything with Dr Grey’s words except hold them but he feels calmer after their conversation
It clears his head a little allowing him to focus on the upcoming mission
Now that he isn’t quite as stressed out over his personal issues he is free to stress out over the mission
The more he does the worse he feels about it until one night he is searching the base for Carolina
He finds her in one of the smaller meeting rooms armored up and pouring over her datapad
I think your intel is wrong he says before he can second guess himself
Carolina pauses
Excuse me
Wash forces himself not to fidget in the doorway
The numbers from your reconnaissance run
They don’t make any sense
When Carolina continues to say nothing Wash plows into the room and drops his own datapad on the table in front of her
Look
This warehouse is huge
There has to be more than a couple dozen boxes of ammo in the main storage room there’s either way more or something else is going on there
You think
Epsilon asks popping up over Carolina’s shoulder
Wash pointedly ignores him
We need to rethink this whole thing
We need more troops divided up into smaller groups
We need Pelicans lots of them circling or posted up nearby in case there is a lot of ammo
We needlook I made up this chart here see
Carolina tugs Wash’s datapad towards her and observes it with a critical eye before glancing back up at him
You’ve put a lot of thought into this
Several days’ worth I suppose
Several days or several nights
Epsilon mutters
Wash glares at him
Carolina sighs
Wash why didn’t you come to me when this first crossed your mind
Wash falters at that
II don’t know boss
Because if you had I would’ve told you that I agree
You what
Carolina pushes her own datapad towards him and Wash can see that her own mission dossier is almost identical to the one he’s marked up
I’ve gone back to the warehouse
Several times now
The numbers didn’t sit right with me either
It looks like Charon put some sort of shield up around the building something to scramble the numbers
Epsilon and I took it down and welllet’s just say there’s way more than a few dozen boxes of ammunition
So you’re saying I’m saying that I think we found their main stockpile
She stands hand clenching into fists
And we are going to go and get it
Relief floods its way through Wash’s veins
Of course Carolina saw it
Of course Carolina fixed it
Suddenly he feels stupid for doubting her in the first place
Sorry boss
I should’ve known you’d catch this
Wash Carolina throws a half glance towards Epsilon one that Wash recognizes as the two of them conferring inside her head
With a grumble Epsilon vanishes
Wash you know this isn’t Freelancer right
Wash frowns
Of course I know that
Good
Because it’s not
Carolina stands suddenly moving across the room to stare out the window
I know I wasn’tthe best leader back then
You were a great leader
I wasn’t she says sharply
Not when it mattered
I was stubborn and competitive and I didn’t always like to listen
Wash hesitates before coming to stand next to her at the window
You also saved all of our lives many times over Carolina
Not when it mattered
She lets out a bitter sigh before turning to face him
I want you to feel like you can come to me with stuff like this Wash
I’m not your leader anymore
It’s just us now
We have to work together
It’s the only thing that will keep us from missing stuff andand losing another team
He forgets sometimes
Forgets that he isn’t the only person the Reds and Blues have stitched back together piece by piece
It had annoyed him when Carolina and Epsilon had left at the crash site but he was unsurprised to see her again standing in front of them and unable to hide the beaming smile in her voice
I never thought I’d be so glad to see you idiots again
Wash thinks of the way he’d woken up to see her bending over him after he’d been beaten bloody from his fight with Locus
She had come back for him; had brought him straight to Tucker and the rest of his men had caught him before he passed out on the floor of the Pelican
She had come back for him
I’m glad you’re here Wash says suddenly because he can’t quite say I forgive you
Not because it isn’t true he thinks it is these days but because he can’t talk about it yet about Freelancer about the burning infirmary about his head cracked open for the world to see
He doesn’t think she can either
Me too Wash
She takes a breath and looks back at their datapads on the table
Now let’s get to work
We have a mission to plan
It takes the two of them the better part of a day to structure the mission to their satisfaction decide who would be on which squad recruit select squad and assemble the whole lot of them for a mission debriefing
In the end Wash ends up with Tucker Sarge Caboose Fitz Britton and Andersmith on his team
None of his squad will actually retrieving the ammunition they are to act as guards for the many teams that will be hauling the boxes onto the Pelicans
Caboose Fitz Britton and Andersmith will remain with the Pelican to guard it help with the loading and if need be ready to take off with them at a moment’s notice
Wash will be patrolling the actual warehouse with Tucker and Sarge
Carolina will lead a similar squad on the south end of the warehouse and there will be several more teams working on the retrieval
Wash is met with mixed reactions when he finds his team to tell them of their mission directives
Fitz and Andersmith both wring his hand solemnly
Britton bursts into tears overwhelmed and promising that she won’t let him down
I hear you’re a hell of a pilot Wash tells her awkwardly as she sniffles away in front of him
He’d found out only recently that Britton had been the one piloting the Pelican that had come for him and the Reds and Blues at the tower
He remembers dimly that the Pelican had landed as smoothly and closely as possible to where Tucker lay and zoomed away the second they were all inside
I’m counting on you to get us out of there fast if we need it
Yes sir
Britton says again and takes off presumably to inform all of her friends of her upcoming mission
Caboose takes the news as he does all news cheerfully with hugs given to everyone in the nearby vicinity
Sarge spends a good ten minutes lamenting over the fact that he will be the only member of Red Team on this squad but ultimately decides that One Red is better than none can’t have all these damn dirty Blues screwing up a mission of such vital importance
When he finds Tucker lifting weights and tells him the mission assignments Tucker just nods as if it were a given
When Wash asks Tucker rolls his eyes
Well of course we’re gonna be on the same squad
They’d have to be idiots not to pair us up
Wash looks at him suspiciously
Why’s that
Uh because we make a fucking awesome team
Tucker lifts an eyebrow suggestively
In more ways than one I’ll bet
Wash huffs but doesn’t hide his smile
Well
We’ll see about that
Tucker pauses in the act of unclamping a barbell to stare at Wash
Wait we will
Wash shrugs feeling a little silly but he plows onward
Maybe
I guess it depends on howconvincing you can be
Tucker throws the clamp aside and all but leaps into Wash’s personal space tripping spectacularly over the barbell as he does
This time his stumbling fall is genuine and when Wash catches him they’re both laughing
Smooth Wash says and lets his hands rest carefully on Tucker’s hips as Tucker makes a production out of steadying himself
Tucker grins and snakes his arms around Wash’s neck
Wash’s breath catches in his throat as Tucker lines them up thighs to shoulders and presses his hips forward ever so slightly
Oh-ho Wash I can be very convincing
He buries his head into the crook of Wash’s neck dragging his lips up slowly so that they’re flush against Wash’s ear
They do call me the doctor of love
Wash makes a noise that is most definitely not a whimper as he feels Tucker’s breath on his neck before toying with the edge of Tucker’s t-shirt
He runs his fingertips along the sliver of bare skin there before pressing his palms to the small of Tucker’s back
Wash grins delighted at the resulting gasp and runs his hands up and down Tucker’s back a few times before pulling away reluctantly
Tucker’s hands trail along his arms as he does as if he wants to keep touching Wash’s skin for as long as possible
Let’s Wash clears his throat and Tucker smirks at the strangled note in his voice
Let’sfocus on this mission
Then

Then
Tucker prompts with a wink
Then we cansee Wash says awkwardly
We’ll justwe’ll just see
Whatever you want Wash Tucker says as Wash shuffles out of the room
And I do mean whatever
The morning of the mission dawns far too soon and the energy that descends on the Pelican bay is simultaneously anxious and giddy
Carolina’s goes over their mission directives again and in a reasonably organized fashion they all make their way onto their respective Pelicans and take off
So says Sarge the moment they’re all airborne
What do you all say we play a game
He whips a deck of cards seemingly out of nowhere
Ooooooh I wanna play
Britton calls from the front of the Pelican
No wait Wash protests as Caboose nearly knocks him over in his haste to draw cards from Sarge’s hand
We should go over the plan again
Dude we’ve gone over the plan a thousand times Tucker says with a yawn
Britton flies Caboose Andersmith and the Fitz haul the boxes onboard and the three of us do like recon and shit
Badass
Let’s do it
Now will you relax and play some cards with us
Wash does not in fact play cards but he doesn’t stop the rest of them from playing
Caboose plays Britton’s hand as well as his own and Wash has to admit that the game does help take away some of the tension
Wash spends a fair amount of the Pelican ride glancing suspiciously at Sarge he still hasn’t said anything about Wash barging in on him and Dr Grey and Wash has a sinking feeling that he’s waiting for the perfect moment
Thankfully that moment is not now
When the Pelican finally lands Wash exits with a final nod to Tucker and Sarge
Wait for my signal
We will Wash stop worrying Tucker says exasperated and Wash heads around the western side of the warehouse
A quick check-in with Carolina confirms that she’s on the eastern side as planned
He’s seen the warehouse several times in pictures now but he’s still taken aback at how big the building is
Still it hardly takes any time at all for the two of them to take out the handful of guards staggered around the entrance and Wash waits anxiously for Epsilon to disarm the alarm set around the perimeter
Alright done
I’m looping the security footage
How long can you give us
Wash asks glancing around
No reinforcements that he can see
Please
I can do this shit forever
You just worry about the ammo
Wash rolls his eyes but focuses on entering the structure
The ammo is everywhere boxes and boxes of it lined up neatly and apparently theirs for the taking
Boss are you seeing this
Looks like we hit the jackpot she murmurs delighted
Let’s check the perimeter and I’ll report in to Kimball
They triple check the room before calling the others in one by one
Wash nods to Tucker and Sarge as the skulk over to him
Alright
Sarge you take the eastern side
Tucker you monitor the south and I’ll monitor the northwest
Within thirty minutes they’ve sent five Pelicans back to the base loaded with ammunition
They’ve checked every single box for traps or bombs but everything is clean
It’s a miracle
It must be too good to be true
Relax Tucker sighs over the radio when Wash voices this concern
Is it really so hard to believe that these fuckers have underestimated us again
Well Wash hesitates
Let’s just wrap this up and get out of here as soon as possible alright
He continues his patrol of the warehouse rifle up and at the ready
He listens to the sounds of the various teams whooping and cheering over the radio as their Pelicans take off and grins in spite of himself
They deserved this
They deserved a bit of hope
They deserved something good
Wash rounds the corner to make his way down a corridor he had previously only glanced down and the utter silence that follows screams its warning
It had been silent before but were still underlying sounds in the background the hum of the temperature control modulators the sigh of the overhead fans
When Wash turns the corner in the moment between one footfall and the next there is a resounding hush that sets the hair on the back of his neck standing up
Wash tries wrench his foot backwards but it’s too late to stop his descent from triggering a trap and his foot hits the floor
It doesn’t stay there for long
The world explodes smokefirelightNOISE and Wash curls in on himself as the explosion blasts him nearly six feet in the air
His back hits the wall hard head snapping back against the stone directly above his implantation site and the pain is so intense that it turns his vision black and his body boneless
When he comes to he’s lying flat on his back coughing up at the ceiling
The back of his head feels wet and sticky inside of his helmet and his HUD is telling him that he’s hurt warning of possible concussion or stress fracture or
Go
He needs to go
Wash forces feeling back into his limbs and tries to roll over to a stand but his legs aren’t listening
For several heart-stopping seconds he’s sure that he’s been paralyzed
It takes him far longer than it should to actually glance down his body and see the pile of rubble lying across his legs bits of plaster and chunks of stone and most worryingly a large section of one of the many pillars holding the room up
Wash pushes ineffectually at the pillar and tries to worm his body out from under it but it’s too heavy
He needs help
Tuck-er he slurs and spends a few seconds blinking dazedly at the inside of his helmet before he realizes that his radio is off
He paws at the sides of his helmet until he finds the dial that opens up his radio spins it until he gets to his squad’s frequency and
Static
Nothing but static
A cold prickle of fear slides down the back of his neck
They’re fine he tells himself
They’re fine you’re all fine everything’s going to be fine
He flips through several channels trying to find a new frequency but all he hears is static static static
The smoke rising up to the ceiling grows thicker and thicker as Wash struggles with his radio; there's another beat of yawning silence and then- And then the building's alarms start to howl and time cracks open inside his head
Adrenaline pulses through his body and Wash jolts struggling desperately against the rubble pinning his legs but to no avail
He falls back gasping pressing his hands to the side of his helmet and
There must be something wrong with his auditory filters; there’s no way the alarms could possibly be this loud
They blare on and on sliding inside his skull filling the furrows and cracks where Epsilon was ripped out with their sound
Epsilon he says and his voice sounds sick and delirious to his own ears
Epsilon I’m Wash shoves the memory down hard hands pressing tight to the side of his helmet
Chorus he croaks because it helps to say it out loud even though he can’t hear his own voice over the scream of the alarms
You’re on Chorus
S’okay
Name is Agent Washington and you’re on Chorus
He squeezes his eyes shut tight against the flashing red lights and the smoke
He fumbles with the radio ignores the increasingly frantic warnings from his HUD and opens their private Freelancer channel again saying the first thing that comes to mind
Maine he slurs
Maine
I’m all fucked up
I need you to come get me
Christ he sounds bad he doesn’t know what he’s saying and besides Maine isn’t coming for him can’t come for him because he isn’t there any more he isn’t
He isn’t on the MOI
He’s on Chorus
Wash latches onto this desperate thought forces his eyes back open to stare at the warehouse ceiling not the infirmary with its twisted metal bedframes and flames licking the walls
Maine isn’t here he tells himself firmly
You have a new team now
You need to call them
You need
Tucker he says again and fumbles with the frequencies until he lands on the Blue Team channel the one they’ve used ever since
Rockslide he says and opens the channel
Tucker
C’boose
M’on the northwest side of the warehouse an’an’ I think my head is broken and It is it is broken he can feel the blood on the back of his neck and whenever he moves the room swims sickeningly
There is no answer on any radio frequency that he tries no answer on his in-text reader
They’ve fallen; the ship has fallen from the sky and there is no answering voice on the radio he tries to call their names but can’t they won’t come his head is full of bloodied broken bits of glass and still the alarms scream and scream and scream and scream and scream and

Goddammit
Tucker slams a hand against the nearest wall and resists the urge to throw his useless helmet across the warehouse
Fucking fuck
Captain Tucker use your words Carolina says sharply
What’s the situation
Wash isn’t answering me he’s not answering anyone
I think his radio’s busted
Fuck
Okay Carolina says
Tucker kind of wants to strangle her for the ridiculously calm note in her voice because how she can be calm in a time like this

Okay I’m going to go find him and
Fuck that Tucker says
He’s already sprinting towards the spiraling smoke the alarms wailing overhead
I know exactly where he is
Right in the middle of that gigantic fucking explosion
Tucker
No shut up
I’m going
You’re all the way on the other side of the building
I’m closer and I’m going
Fine Carolina says after a beat of silence
Tucker be careful there could be more traps
Yeah and speaking of that Tucker leaps over fallen debris
Weren’t you and Church supposed to be disarming the traps when you scouted the place out
Hey we did
Epsilon protests
Tucker wants to strangle him as well
And I disarmed a fuckton of them so
Not the ones that counted though did you
Tucker
I’m almost there Tucker says tightly
I’ll radio you when I’ve got him
He switches off his radio shoving down the dull pulse of guilt
All that matters now is finding Wash
Tucker opens up his squad’s frequency once more
Anyone hear from him yet
His heart sinks as a chorus of no’s echo back at him
Wash
You there
I’m coming to get you dude
There’s no answer from Wash and after a few seconds all of his teammates let out their breath in a disappointed whoosh
Is Agent Washington going to be okay
Britton asks voice a thready whisper
That explosion was sooo big He’s gonna be fine Tucker says firmly concentrating hard on her words
He cranks up the radio volume in his helmet and tries his best to drown out the alarms
You just worry about having that plane ready to go okay
It’ll be ready Britton says stronger and Tucker resumes his frantic scrolling through various frequencies
There’s no answer from Wash on any of them not Blue Team’s channel not their shared channel with the Reds nothing
He can’t even hear Wash breathing which can only mean that his radio’s down
That’s the only thing it can mean
He slows down the closer he gets to the smoke keeping an eye out for more traps for enemy soldier for movement for Wash
Clear
Clear
Clear
Tucker inches slowly through the rows and it’s all clear and that word is rattling around in his head loud and silent at the same time and he steps again clears steps and almost misses
Movement
There’s movement
It’s slow and sluggish but it’s Wash and he’s moving hands pawing at his helmet
Tucker’s heart leaps straight into his throat and he plunges forward fuck clearing the room skidding to a halt and dropping to his knees next to Wash
Wash
Holy shit dude are you okay
Wash is the exact opposite of okay
There’s no visible blood or signs of broken bones but there’s a gigantic pillar across his legs that Tucker has a sinking feeling he won’t be able to lift on his own
What’s worse Wash is clearly panicking chest heaving with uneven gasps that Tucker can’t hear over the scream of the alarms
The moment Tucker crouches down next to him Wash stops struggling with his helmet to grasp desperately at Tucker’s arm
C’rlinaLina you’re here
Tucker freezes hands faltering in their frantic progress to check Wash’s body for injury
Wash’s voice is muddled and sluggish and what’s worse there’s a complete lack of recognition in his tone that sends a cold wave of fear through Tucker’s body
Shock
He has to be in shock; Tucker can feel how badly Wash is shaking even through both of their armor
Wash hey it’s me
It’s Tucker
Carol-ina Wash gasps again his hands tight and desperate against Tucker’s forearm
You came back
Tucker swallows down his own panic and takes a closer look at Wash’s helmet
There’s something smoking out of the side his busted radio Tucker would bet and judging from his disorientation Tucker is certain he hit his head
He hesitates free hand hovering over the seals on Wash’s helmet but the alarms are blaring at an ungodly volume
He fiddles with the external auditory filters on Wash’s helmet instead but they seem to be fucked up as well
Tucker muffles the sound of the alarms as best he can then opens a direct line to Carolina on his own radio
Carolina I’ve got him
Can’t you guys turn these goddamn alarms off
I’m trying
Epsilon huffs
What happened
Is he okay
No he’s not fucking okay
Tucker what’s wrong
Carolina interrupts
He
Tucker glances at Wash who has let go of his arm and has resumed trying to wrench off his helmet
Wash no you gotta leave that on it’s way too fucking loud in here
Tucker I’m coming to you Carolina says
No
Tucker tugs Wash’s hands away from his helmet
Give me a second to figure this out
There’s probably a billion reinforcements on their way and you’re our best chance against them
You have to stay where you are
You’ll just confuse him
Tucker glances uneasily at Wash
It’s just the armor color that’s throwing him off he tells himself
Anyone would be disoriented after an explosion like that
Look just just perimeter and shit okay
I’ve got this
Fine Carolina grits out after a beat
But I want an update as soon as you have one
Tucker snaps off his radio and turns his attention back to Wash who is clutching at Tucker’s hands
Think the ship crashed he slurs C’rlina I think the ship crashed and I
I think my head’s broken
Okay
Tucker detangles his hands from Wash’s and pops the seals on his own helmet tugging it off his head and wincing as the alarms hit
Wash look
It’s me
Tucker
It’s Tucker
Wash falters for a moment and Tucker holds his gaze forcing himself to wait it out until
Tucker
Wash says hesitantly and Tucker lets out a shaky breath
Yeah dude
Tucker hastens to reseal his helmet muffling the alarms once more
Where are you hurt
I can’t move Wash says his voice coming out high and strangled
Tuck’r I can’t move
I know it’s okay I’m gonna get you out of here Tucker glances anxiously towards the pillar a horrific thought suddenly occurring to him
Wash can you feel your legs
I Wash moves his legs experimentally
Yes
Thank fucking Christ
Okay
Okay
Good that’s good
We just have to move this and
The alarms blessedly cut off and Tucker wilts in relief
Okay Wash
I’m gonna take off your helmet okay
’Kay Wash says
Think it’s broken
M’head
Your head’s not broken Tucker says firmly easing Wash’s helmet off
There’s blood alright but not as much as Tucker was expecting
He’s far more concerned about the wide dazed look in Wash’s eyes
Wash
Hey
Follow my finger
Tucker moves his finger around a bit feeling ridiculous he isn’t entirely sure what he’s supposed to be looking for but something tells him that the way Wash’s eyes slide in and out of focus isn’t good
He gently pats around the back of Wash’s head and hides a wince as his glove comes away stained bright red
Right over his implant site too which means no biofoam
Fuck
Okay Tucker says
Okay okay okay
Wash I’m gonna try to move this pillar
Just can you put your hands under it and try to push a little like yeah like that
Wash gets his hands under the pillar as best as he can but the leverage is minimal and he soon falls back gasping
The two of them haven’t so much as budged the goddamn thing
Fuck Tucker mutters glancing around
Okay let me just
No
Wash grabs onto his wrist as Tucker turns away to look for something they can use his sluggish bewilderment instantly morphing into a sharp panic
Tucker don’t leave me here please
Tucker is kneeling by Wash’s head again in an instant the hairs on the back of his neck standing up because holy fuck
He doesn’t ever want to hear Wash sound like that again
Hey
Wash
I’m not gonna leave you I promise
" I’ll try harder Wash says
I can lift this I can do it just don’t go I can’t if you go if you go
I’m not
I’m not going anywhere
Listen
I’m gonna radio for backup and then you and me are gonna wait right here until more of our guys come and get this fucking thing off of you
Okay
I’m not leaving
I’m going to protect you
Okay
Wash squeezes his eyes shut pressing his head back into the ground
I can’t feel ‘im
Tucker freezes in the act of turning on his radio
What
Epsilon Wash says and Tucker can now hear his teeth chattering hard
I think he’s gone I think II think I fucked up I think the ship crashed and I can’t feel him ‘nymore
Wash
You’re onyou’re on Chorus remember
This isn’t Freelancer
It’s Chorus
Remember
Wash looks at him and Tucker can see all at once that he doesn’t remember
Tucker takes a deep breath letting Wash’s panic level out his own and opens a radio to his squad
He can handle this
He has to handle this
Okay guys
I
Tucker winces as five different voices interrupt him with frantic inquiries
Did you find Agent Washington where are you what in Sam Hill is going on over there what should we do Captain Tucker I think I see Pelicans in the distance
For a moment Tucker freezes again
It’s too much the voices of his teammates the sound of Wash’s increasingly ragged breathing the smoke swirling around them
This is bad this is really bad and if Tucker doesn’t figure it out then it’s going to get worse
He glances again at Wash and with a deep breath finds his hand and gives it a reassuring squeeze
Everyone shut the fuck up and listen to me
Tucker snaps over the radio and they all falter
Okay
This is what we’re gonna do
Britton I need that Pelican ready to take off the second we arrive
Andersmith and Fitz guard the entrance ramp
If you see any signs of trouble I want to hear about it
Caboose
Yes hello
Caboose yells over the radio
Hello Tucker
Caboose I need your help
Wash is stuck underunder a heavy thing I need you to come to the part of the warehouse that has all the smoke and bright red lights and lift it the fuck off of him
Now
Okay
Caboose chirps
Hurry but be careful
Sarge where are you
Almost at your position now Blue
Comin’ on over to save the day in true Red Team fashion
Okay just just cover us okay
Don’t come down here just keep an eye on the aisles nearby
Carolina and Church how’s that perimeter
The perimeter’s fine Carolina says impatient
Are you sure you don’t want us to
Yes I’m sure
Look Wash is he’s kind of disoriented right now and we don’t need fifteen fucking people hovering around
Just watch the goddamn perimeter
There’s a beat of icy silence and a dim part of Tucker’s mind registers that maybe he shouldn’t have yelled at her in front of the squad
That larger part doesn’t really give a shit
Okay Captain she says calmly and leaves it at that
Did we get all the goddamn ammo
Tucker asks
They’re loading the last boxes onto the Pelican now Andersmith says
Good
Glad this wasn’t all for nothing
Caboose
Almost there
Okay
Britton I’ll check in when we’re on our way
Tucker out
He signs off and gives Wash’s hand another squeeze
Hey
You okay
Wash looks at him eyes sliding into focus
Tucker
Yeah
It’s me
It’s Tucker
A crash has him whipping around but it’s only Caboose stomping down their corridor
Hello everyone
Tucker sighs in shaky relief
Caboose I have never been so happy to see you
Yes well Caboose says smugly I am here to save the day sooo
Tucker rolls his eyes
Aaaaand you fucking ruined it
Just get all this shit off of him okay
Okay
Caboose examines the pile for a brief moment before hauling off some of the larger pieces of rock
It’s okay Wash I will move all of the heavy things and we will fly away very soon
Caboose Tucker tells Wash quietly
Caboose is here
Yeah
Wash takes a deep breath giving his head a little shake
Yeah
I
I know
Good
That’s great that’s
Tucker’s jerking around again at the sound of something whirring behind him hand flying to the hilt of his sword
Anger and relief course through him as Carolina rounds the corner an aqua blur with her speed modulators screeching to a halt
I said Caboose
Tucker says furiously
Unless Caboose shrank three fucking feet and cloned himself in the last two minutes you’re not him
There are Pelicans approaching and they’re not ours Carolina says shortly
This is taking too long
Tucker ignores the sting of hurt her words bring
Listen I have the strongest person on this squad lifting this shit off of him so I’m not sure what you think you’re gonna do
Carolina ignores him dropping to a crouch next to Wash
Washington report
Are you all right
Wash flinches his grip on Tucker’s hand tightening
Crl’ina
I’m right here she says
We’re going to get you out of here
Can you feel your
Lina Wash says and that shaky not-quite-there note is back in his voice
Lina I think the ship crashed
Carolina pauses in her movements perplexed
The ship
Wash Tucker says loudly
Look at me
C’mon stay here
Is everyone else okay
York was here but he had to goit was too heavyhe couldn’t lift it Wash grabs suddenly at Carolina’s arm who has frozen completely
Lina don’t go you can’t go Tucker grits his teeth
Carolina back up
I told you he was disoriented; you’re confusing him
To Tucker’s horror Epsilon chooses that exact moment to appear clapping his hands together
Alright we got about five minutes before those Pelicans are on us
Let’s move it people we don’t have all goddamn
Epsilon
Wash asks and it’s so different so startlingly different from the stiff way in Wash usually addresses him that everyone freezes even Caboose
Epsilon whas’ going on
Epsilon stares at Wash for a moment hands falling limply to his sides before he turns to Tucker like it’s his fault and hisses What the fuck happened
We crashed Wash says his voice shaky and delirious
I think the ship crashed and I
Epsilon I think something’s wrong I can’t where are you
I’m
I’m right here Epsilon says numbly and instead of logging off like he fucking should be he steps forward into Wash’s line of sight
Wash holds out his palm and after a long moment Epsilon steps into it
I can’t can’t feel you Wash says still in that same shaky voice
For the briefest of moments Epsilon hesitates like he’s actually fucking considering doing the unthinkable and that’s just about enough for Tucker
Church he says struggling to keep his voice even
You need to log off
Now
The fucker isn’t paying him the slightest bit of attention
It’s okay Wash
We’re gonna get you the fuck out of here okay
Tucker can’t decide if he wants to scream or throttle Epsilon or Carolina or maybe every single person in Wash’s past who had anything to do with the way he’s falling to pieces
He reaches across Wash and puts a firm hand on Carolina’s forearm who hasn’t moved in minutes
For all Tucker knows she’s fucking up and died right there on the spot
She starts looking at him
Carolina you need to go
Now
You and Church need to go to go fuck off for a while
I’m not leaving him Epsilon says still standing in Wash’s open palm like he has every right to be there
Tucker learns the meaning of seeing red
Yeah well you know what Church
It's kind of sounding to me like you already made that choice a long time ago
There’s the sound of silence of Caboose shuffling the rocks of Wash’s panicked breathing
Church Tucker growls
I swear to fucking God
Get
Out
Of
Here
Epsilon come on Carolina says and she stands
Epsilon flickers away
Wait Wash says and the hair on Tucker’s neck stands up again at the hysterical cadence voice takes Wait wait
Okay Tucker says
He reaches up to undo his helmet
It’s a little tricky given that he’s still clutching Wash’s hand and isn’t planning on letting go unless someone chops his arm off but he manages it
He turns Wash’s face towards him with his free hand
Okay
Wash look at me
Wash does
His eyes stop their frantic searching as they lock onto Tucker’s and there is a terrifying moment in which Tucker does not see recognition in his eyes
He takes a deep breath pushing down his own dread
Dude c’mon it’s me
It’s Tucker
You’re on Chorus
Everything’s okay he says even though it’s not not not
Wash squeezes his eyes shut and when he opens them again they’re a little clearer
Tucker he says
You you're my we’re
We’re fucking Tucker says wildly
Well okay no we’re not but we’re gonna be
We’ve got this super hot slow build thing going on and the sex is gonna be awesome
Wash gives him a shaky smile I’ll uh
I’ll take your word for it
I’ve got you Tucker says
We’ve got you
We’re getting you out of here
He squeezes Wash’s hand tighter still as Caboose finally gets his shoulder underneath the pillar and pushes hard
He heaves the whole thing off Wash with little more than a grunt
Wash hisses in pain but Tucker’s relieved to see him moving his legs experimentally
ThanksCaboose
Thanks
You’re welcome Agent Washington says Caboose and he bends down on Wash’s other side
He and Tucker each take an arm tugging Wash to his feet
Tucker is just opening his mouth to suggest a fireman’s carry because Wash is still shaking pretty badly but Caboose hoists Wash onto his back without a word
Caboose Wash protests
You don’t have to
It’s okay Wash Caboose says cheerfully
I used to give my sisters piggy back rides all the time
Sometimes ah sometimes just for fun and sometimes if they got hurt and scrapped a knee and it hurt too much to walk
I can walk Wash says despite the fact that he can barely talk without slurring his words
I’m fine II’m fine
Caboose sighs
That’s what they would say too
And that was very silly because they weren’t fine and when people aren’t fine they should say something because
See because I am very strong
And I could carry my sisters home for a long way and I wouldn’t get tired
He readjusts Wash on his back
I can carry my brothers home too
You are not that much heavier Wash
Wash’s whole face crumples and he presses his forehead into the back of Caboose’s armor
Okay Caboose he says locking his arms around Caboose’s neck
Thanks buddy
You are welcome Wash
Tucker hands Wash his helmet and it dangles limply in his hand
Tucker slams his own helmet back on and gets out his gun he doesn’t want anyone to get within twenty goddamn feet of them and they set a brisk pace towards the Pelican meeting up with Sarge a few rows over
Coast is clear he says glancing between Caboose and Wash
Where do I sign up for m’own piggyback ride
I will give you one on the Pelican Sergeant
Son how many times do I have to tell you that it’s Colonel
Right
Colonel Sergeant
Well I suppose that’ll do Sarge matches his pace to Caboose’s and peers right into Wash’s face
You don’t look so good buttercup
Sarge Tucker snaps but shuts his mouth when he sees Wash give a weak smile
Hmph says Sarge
Well
You just take your little cat nap and Red Team will handle everything as usual
They make their way to the Pelican steps hastening as the roar of ships in the distance grows closer
Britton’s voice comes anxiously over the radio
Captain Tucker we need to move out
There are five Pelicans approaching
Okay okay we’re almost there They round the corner to see Andersmith and Fitz hovering at the entrance ramp to their Pelican and they charge on
GO
Fitz yells and Britton lifts off before the ramp is fully closed
HOLD ON she yells from the front and Tucker hangs onto the one of the handles near the ramp for dear life glancing around wildly to make sure that everyone else is secure
Sarge and Caboose have steadied Wash between them and they all hold on as Britton launches them into the sky the ramp slowly closing
They make it by the skin of their teeth
Tucker watches as the other Pelicans descend at the same time theirs rises Britton weaving in between theirs
The last thing he sees before their ramp slams shut is another ramp opening and a glimpse of steel and orange in the distance
They all let out shaky sighs of relief and as Tucker turns he sees Carolina braced at the head of the Pelican as if she has any right to be there
Tucker shoots her a glare before yanking a first aid kit off the wall and coming to kneel in front of Wash
How are you feeling dude
Wash blinks up at him hands patting weakly at the back of his head
Tucker tries not to focus on how they come back glistening
’Are we going back to t’ship
No Tucker says firmly
We’re going back to the base
Armonia remember
Armonia Wash mumbles Armonia
On Chorus
Hey he taps at Wash’s chin until he opens his eyes
Stay with me okay
Wash nods and Tucker climbs to his feet
In his peripheral he sees Andersmith and Fitz exchange a glance and whirls to face everyone
Guys seriously
Back up
You heard the man
Sarge snaps
He is in fact the only one not crowded around Wash and whips out his deck of cards again with a flourish
C’mon kids gather round
I’ve got a few more asses to whoop at blackjack
Tucker continues to eyeball everyone until they cluster around Sarge then folds up a wad of gauze
Moving slowly he reaches with the gauze towards the back of Wash’s neck to pad at the excess blood there
Wash’s hand shoots out to grab his wrist something sharp creeping into his gaze for the first time
Waitwait
It’s okay dude Tucker says calmly
You’re just bleeding a little
I’m gonna clean it up
They stare at each other before Wash slowly lets his hand fall nodding stiffly
Wash clenches his hands atop his knees as Tucker wipes the blood away and applies a gauze bandage
His hand fastens around Tucker’s wrist a few more times while he works and Tucker pauses each time he does so
Do you want to do it
No Wash says after a momentary hesitation
No Iyou can probably see better
Yep Tucker says and finishes sealing the bandage over the wound
There all set
Wash reaches up to pat at the bandage while Tucker looks to the front of the Pelican where Carolina is still staring unabashedly
I’ll be right back okay dude
Wash nods his hand running over his ports
Tucker makes his way to the front of the plane gesturing Carolina forward so that the rest of the group can’t see them
What the fuck are you doing here he hisses
This isn’t your Pelican
My squad already left Carolina says stiffly
I needed to make sure you were all okay
You’ve got to be fucking kidding me
Carolina
Did you totally miss that shit show back there
Seeing you is just gonna confuse him
Epsilon appears in front of her face
Look you don’t have to be such an asshole about it
Oh my god Church
That goes double for you
Tucker glances between the two of them
Seriously
Get the fuck out of here
C’mon Epsilon Carolina says quietly
Let’s sit up front
Yeah you do that
Just just go where he can’t see you and when we get back I want a fucking explanation for what just happened
Carolina turns back around her voice finally turning angry
What makes you think I owe you an explanation
Tucker is absolutely out of fucks to give
He leans closer to her
I’m his team
I’m his
I’m his friend and I need to know what the fuck to say to him
If Wash hasn’t told you what happened in Freelancer then
Tucker cuts him off
Church I am so fucking sick of that bullshit excuse from you so don’t even start
He looks back to Carolina
He thought I was going to leave him there
He reallyhe really thought I’d leave him
" Silence
Epsilon finally stops flitting around angrily coming to a slow halt on Carolina’s shoulder
That’s what happened isn’t it
Tucker continues glancing between the two of them
Something happened on that ship and he was stuck there and no one fucking got him out
It’s a little more complicated than that Epsilon says
Well then explain it to me
When neither of them answer he sighs and tries to make his voice less accusatory
I don’t understand
You had a whole fucking squad of Freelancers right
Why didn’t anyone think to get him out of a burning ship
Why didn’t you
Carolina was at the bottom of a cliff trying to put her own head back together Epsilon snaps
He appears undaunted when Carolina rounds on him furiously
No this is bullshit like you just decided to leave Wash there
What did you decide Church
Epsilon falters again and Tucker shakes his head angrily
He kept asking for you
He thought you were still there in his fucking head
You left him didn’t you
You all just
 just fucking left
It’s
Complicated Tucker says
Yeah
I’ll fucking bet
He turns away
The Pelican ride drags on and on
Wash jolts in and out of consciousness despite Tucker and Caboose’s best efforts to keep him talking
Each time Wash jerks back awake it is with that same frantic disorientation
He grows quieter and quieter the closer they get to the base and when they do Tucker peers out one of the windows with a groan
Fuck he hisses
There’s a thousand people on this ramp
Andersmith go fucking clear the landing zone
We don’t need an audience
Fitz you go with him
Within a few minutes they have the area clear
Tucker turns to see Sarge slinging one of Wash’s arms over his shoulder and Tucker ducks under the other one
Caboose picks up Wash’s helmet and carries it with them
They meet Dr Grey halfway to the infirmary which is thankfully not far from the landing bay
Oh dear she chirps peering into Wash’s eyes as they walk
Oh that is most certainly a concussion
Caboose the door please
Caboose holds open the door and they all start to shuffle into the infirmary
Wait Wash says suddenly speaking for the first time in nearly thirty minutes
Wait wait
I don’t need to go to the hospital
I’m fine
Don’t be silly Dr Grey says firmly
You are the opposite of fine
Chop chop let’s get inside now
Wash doesn’t resist as Tucker and Sarge maneuver him into the infirmary and set him down on one of the beds but he does immediately start trying to clamber to his feet
Tucker puts a hand on his elbow as he sways
Dr Grey takes off her helmet turning to Sarge
Now it is very important that no one barges in here while I am trying to work
Do you think you could take care of that for me
You got it darlin’ Sarge says gruffly
Tucker’s eyes bulge as he leans his head down towards her and she places an absent-minded kiss on the corner of his helmet
Thank you Colonel
Tucker stares open-mouthed as Sarge swaggers out of the room
Alright listen up
I need this hallway cleared in
His voice cuts out as the door swings shut and Tucker clears his throat
Uh so when exactly did you two
I’m not staying here Wash says
Tucker lets go of his elbow but stays close
Oh yes you are Dr Grey says
Now sit back down on that bed
I’m fine Wash says and he lifts his chin defiantly
Dr Grey slams down the medical scanner she was readying and whirls to face him
Agent Washington you are not fine
You are quite possibly the farthest thing from fine that I have ever seen and I have seen my share of not fine things
You are going to sit back down and you are going to let me give you a proper head examination and then you are going to stay here overnight for observation
No Wash says loudly
No
I’m not
I’m not staying in this hospital bed overnight I won’t
Wash I’m sorry but you really must Dr Grey says undaunted
Given your history of past head trauma it is very important that you be monitored during sleeping and woken up every two hours
I won’t sleep Wash says wildly
No one has to wake me I’ll stay awake I will I’ll
That isn’t a better solution
Wash Tucker mutters
Look maybe
They both ignore him
I’m not staying here Wash says slowly
I’m not staying in this hospital and you can’t make me
Oh Washington let me assure you that I not only can but will
You are injured and you are my patient and you are not
Leaving
This room
They stare at each other before Wash snags his helmet and starts towards the door swaying slightly but still determined
Washington Dr Grey says her voice rising don’t you dare take another step towards that door
Wash ignores her continuing his purposeful strides towards the door and for a moment Tucker thinks Dr Grey is going to let him
Tucker’s jaw drops as Dr Grey inserts herself between Wash and the doorway her palms slamming up on either side of the doorframe as she digs her heels in
NO
Wash falters momentarily shocked before toeing up with her
Tucker’s more than a little impressed by the way Dr Grey doesn’t even flinch at the trapped-animal look in his eyes
Look
Dr Grey
I can’t stay here
I can’t be in in a hospital bed you have to let me out of this room
I most certainly do not
The look in Wash’s eyes turns desperate
Emily please
That’s Dr Grey to you Agent Washington
Silence
Tucker holds his breath glancing between the two of them before Dr Grey sighs something softening in her eyes
Wash please understand that I do count you as a dear friend
But she jerks her thumb behind her  you have oodles and oodles of friends lined up for you out there
Right now I can’t be one of them
Right now I am your doctor
And I need you to scoot back into this room and sit down
Now
After a long moment Wash takes a step backwards then another and another until he is seated stiffly on the edge of the bed
Thank you Dr Grey says formally and for the first time she turns her attention to Tucker
Now
Tucker please leave
Tucker balks
What
Are you fucking kidding me
I’m not going anywhere
Her eyes narrow to slits
Oh yes you are
But
Tucker glances at Wash but Wash is staring blankly at the wall in front of him fiddling with his gauntlets
The flat expressionless look on his face is almost worse than the gut-wrenching look of panic he’d worn back at the warehouse and on the Pelican
Wash Wash doesn’t look at him not even when Tucker takes a few hesitant steps forward
Dr Grey swiftly steps in between the two of them and from the look on her face she’s had enough for one day
Captain Tucker get the hell away from my patient or I’ll have you thrown
Out
Wash does look up at that something sharp and seeing on his face at her words before flicking his eyes over to Tucker
S’okay Tucker he says dully
I’m okay
Tucker doesn’t know if he wants to punch him or hug him or kiss his stupid face
You’re not okay he wants to scream
You’re not okay not at all
Dr Grey huffs
I’m not asking you to leave forever silly
Just for a little while
Wash will need a few people checking in on him at two-hour intervals to ask him questions and keep an eye on that pesky concussion
The fact that Wash doesn’t even protest the idea of people waking him up in the middle of the night just continues to stare at the wall tells Tucker all he needs to know about how he’s faring
I can ask around Tucker says desperate to do something useful
See if I can get some people to volunteer
That would be wonderful Tucker thank you Dr Grey says pleasantly then gestures towards the door
Go on then
After one final hesitation Tucker nods slowly
Fine
I’ll be right outside Wash okay
Wash doesn’t answer and Tucker half raises a hand towards him before letting it fall and quietly exiting the room
Well
Sarge asks the moment the door shuts behind him
How’s Princess Freckles
Princess Freckles has had it up to here with all this bullshit Tucker grumbles throwing himself against the wall next to Sarge
And you know what
So have I
That makes a whole lot of us Aquaman
Tucker sighs glancing towards the end of the hallway
Dr Grey wasn’t kidding there are at least two dozen soldiers clustered at the end there a respectful distance away from the infirmary doors but not trying to hide the fact that they’re loitering
As Tucker watches Caboose breaks away from the crowd and shuffles over
Ummm Tucker
Um
He’s fine Caboose Tucker sighs even though it’s not true because what the fuck else is he supposed to say
He’s just he’s just tired
His head is all broken Caboose says sadly
Tucker bristles
It is not Caboose Jesus
Ah well I think it might be
Caboose pauses
It’s okay
Sometimes mine is broken too
Tucker stares at him for a while before clearing his throat
I can’t believe I’m saying this butthanks Caboose
For getting that fucking pillar off of Wash
You uh
You did good
Thank you Tucker
That is very nice of you to say that but I am just happy that I am strong enough to lift the things
Sarge stares between the two of them before muttering Blue Team and stalking off down the hallway
It’s almost two hours before Dr Grey allows Tucker and Caboose back into the infirmary
Just a quick hello she says sternly
He’s had a very trying day and it’s getting late
Wash is out of his armor seated stiffly in his hospital bed
He still has that same blank expression on his face and when he thanks Caboose and Tucker for their help it’s in a voice completely devoid of emotion
They don’t stay long
Dr Grey pulls all the sim troopers into her office after and surveys them with a critical eye
Tucker will deny it if asked but he’s feeling pretty affection towards these assholes all of whom had agreed to take a shift to wake Wash up that night without much complaining or questions
Dr Grey lectures them all on the proper methods of waking someone up during a post-concussion sleep and appropriate questions to ask them
When it’s Tucker’s turn to check in on Wash in the early hours of the morning Wash is already awake arms looped around his knees as he stares out the window
He answers Tucker’s questions quietly robotically as if he’d been repeating them to himself all night
Tucker suspects he has
Tucker stays seated in the chair next to Wash’s bed until dawn begins to break through the windows
Neither of them say a word
So you’re telling me that he was already awake when every single one of you went to check on him
Tucker glances around at the rest of the guys all of whom shrug and nod at each other
They have all gathered in Dr Grey’s office early the next morning to compare notes on Wash’s lucidity after being woken up only to find Dr Grey taps her foot impatiently
Well
Did anyone have to actually wake him up
Maybe he was sleeping in between the check-ups Caboose says helpfully
We can just ask him and
Grif snorts
Yeah like he’s going to answer that honestly
So if he didn’t sleep then Simmons tilts his head
That means he’s been awake for almost twenty-four hours now
Wow did you do that math without a calculator
Shut up Grif
Dr Grey throws up her hands
Oh my goodness gracious
That man she slams a few notebooks around on her desk
Most stubborn patient I’ve everjust unbelievable That’s not good Simmons says bluntly
If he hasn’t slept in twenty-four hours and he doesn’t sleep today
You should watch out for signs of sleep deprivation and
I know what signs to watch out for Captain Simmons
Tucker is utterly unsurprised when she’s kicking them all out of her office two minutes later
He hangs back in the doorway
So how was he this morning when you check on him
Dr Grey glances up surprised to still see him there
Tucker I am not discussing Washington’s private medical information with you
I’m not asking you to
Tucker snaps
I’m justlook I just want to know if he’s okay
She sighs taking a seat and eyeing him
Medically he is fine
The armor saved his legs from any real damage from that pillar
The concussion he suffered was small only worrisome in that Agent Washington has had multiple head injuries at this point and really can’t have another
I’m far more worried about thepsychological scarring that this event could have caused
And he needs to sleep
It is of the utmost importance that he sleep today and if I have to give him a sedative I will
You can’t give him a sedative Tucker says alarmed
He doesn’t react well to them
Dr Grey pauses in reshuffling some papers
What does that mean
He Tucker racks his brain thinking hard back to Rockslide to something that Wash had told him once
They gave him sleeping pills when he was in Recovery after Freelancer because he was having shitty nightmares and wasn’t sleeping
He said that the pills made him sleep but they didn’t stop the dreams so he was like stuck inside them and couldn’t wake up
Like some fucked-up horror movie bullshit
Dr Grey surveys him over the edge of her glasses frowning
He didn’t tell me that
Tucker shrugs uncomfortably
You saw him didn’t you
He probably didn’t remember
Hmm Dr Grey shuffle some more papers until she finds what Tucker presumes to be Wash’s file and makes a note
Thank you Tucker that’s valuable information for me to have
Let me try first Tucker says
Let me try to see if I can get him to take a fucking nap beforebefore you go jabbing sedatives into people Christ
Dr Grey taps a pencil against her desk before sighing
Fine
But if you can’t get him to sleep I will find him and I will find a way to make him sleep
Is that crystal clear
Yeah yeah I got it geez Tucker doesn’t get a chance to speak to Wash until the end of the day
First he has to do a mission debriefing with Kimball and Doyle both of whom are positively giddy over all the ammo that they got
It’s awkward because Carolina and Epsilon are flat out ignoring him across the room which is fine
Just fine
Then he has to help catalogue the ammo and check it all for bombs and help patrol the outer walls of the base because everyone is on edge and help write up an evacuation plan and on and on and on
He doesn’t so much as catch a glimpse of Wash all day
Not in the mess hall not in his room not in the infirmary not even working himself to the bone in the training room
He’s starting to get worried because he wouldn’t put it past Wash at all to take off in order to save them from himself or something ridiculous
After an early evening shower Tucker takes yet another peek in Wash’s room
No Wash but there are various pieces of his armor lying on the floor
Tucker isn’t sure if he’s more alarmed by the fact that only half of Wash’s armor is on the floor or that it’s on the floor in the first place
Wash always took the utmost care of his armor hanging it up neatly and polishing it every week
He was constantly hanging up Caboose’s and Tucker’s back at Rockslide and the crash site and Tucker used to give him shit for it for always hovering and nitpicking and cleaning up after them
For taking care of them Tucker realizes now
He surveys the discarded armor his chest tight and heavy before whirling around and marching off in search of Wash
If he’s wandering around with only bits of his armor on then he’s definitely too exhausted to be wandering anywhere
After a good fifteen minutes of searching the base Tucker finds Wash in some barely-used hallway
Sure enough he’s wearing most of his lower body armor but he’s missing one of the greaves and only one of his arms is covered
He has one hand braced against the wall the other clamped down over the back of his ports and he’s visibly swaying on his feet
Oh boy Tucker sighs and makes his way down the hallway to Wash
Seriously
You need to sit down before you whoa
Wash jerks his arm out of Tucker’s hand the movement sluggish but sure and stumbles backwards
Don’t he says sharply
Just don’t
Tucker holds his hands up
Okay dude
He looks Wash up and down
Messy hair dark circles and paler than Tucker’s ever seen
Where the fuck have you been all day
That’s none of your business Wash says still in that same sharp voice
I don’t
I don’t have to explain myself to you
Wash Tucker says calmly
You really really need to sit down before you pass out
I mean I can do the knight in shining armor thing and carry you back to your room but it’s not exactly right around the corner so
I’m fine
Tucker throws up his hands
Stop saying you’re fine
I AM fine
Silence
Wash rests his forehead against the wall
I am fine he says again quieter
Okay Tucker says
You’re fine I’m fine everything’s fine
But you still need to go lay the fuck down and sleep before you collapse
I’m not sleeping Wash says and Jesus Christ Tucker has never met anyone so stubborn
So what you’re just gonna stay awake
Forever
I can
I can take quick naps Wash says
Here and there I’ve done it before it’s fine
Listen dude Tucker says sharply If you don’t go to sleep Dr Grey is gonna chase you around the base with a fucking sedative
Wash jerks his head away from the wall staring at him
She can’t do that
Sounds to me like she’s pretty fucking determined
She what so she sent you here
To do what
Try to get me to sleep
Tucker folds his arms across his chest glaring at Wash
Something like that
Wash laughs but the sound is all wrong cold and biting and hurtful
Well I’m not sure why she would do that
I don’t
I don’t need you to come here and tell me that I’m
I don’t need you toI don’t need you
Oh-ho my god could you be any more dramatic
He jumps as Wash slams the side of his fist into the wall next to them
Tucker stop
Leave me alone
Just leave me alone and
Yeah we’re skipping this part Tucker interrupts and Wash falters
We’re what
This part
We’re skipping it
He sighs when Wash continues to stare at him blankly
You know the part where you get all fucking melodramatic and try to push me away and tell me I’m too good for you or some other well-rehearsed bullshit
Tucker
We’re skipping the lame ass part where you fucking shut me out and go it alone he says and he steps forward to cups Wash’s tired face fiercely between his hands
Wash lets him
We’re skipping it
That’s not our not our story
Our story is way more fucking interesting
And way more badass
And way sexier
Okay
Tucker feels Wash’s face tighten underneath his palms as he closes his eyes
I don’t
Tucker
I don’t know if I can
I know Tucker says
Dude I know
We’re just gonna just gonna go to sleep
Okay
I’m tired as shit man and I know you are too
If I fall asleep Wash says hollowly I’mI’m afraid that I’llfall
That I’ll wake up and not remember right and
Well that’s why I’m gonna be there
I can remind you
That sounds a hell of a lot better than you being confused all goddamn night
Wash’s hands come up to grip Tucker’s wrists squeezing lightly
I don’tif I hurt you Wash you are way too fucking tired to hurt me or anyone
That’s the problem
If the mercs drop in from the ceiling right this second you’re fucked
He drops his hands from Wash’s face and grabs one of his hands
C’mon
Let’s go to bed
He tugs and after a moment of hesitation Wash follows him
Tucker leads them to Wash’s room thinking that some familiarity might be good
Wash’s bed is perfectly made but there are pieces of his armor scattered around the room
Tucker lets go of Wash’s hand and sets about stacking Wash’s armor neatly off to the side collecting the pieces that Wash drops onto the floor as he unsnaps the rest from his body
By the time he finishes Wash has stepped out of his survival suit and is unfolding a pair of sweatpants
Tucker tries and fails not to stare because holy shit those thighs and that ass
Subtle Tucker Wash sighs as he pulls on the sweatpants but there’s a half-smile pulling at his lips
Dude I can’t help it Tucker says whipping off his own shirt and tossing it in the corner
You look like a fucking  marble statue Jesus Christ
Wash’s eyes flick up and down Tucker’s bare torso before he darts them away embarrassed
Tucker sighs and flops onto Wash’s bed flipping the covers back
Alright come on
Get over here and go the fuck to sleep
Tucker fights hard not to roll his eyes as Wash takes one awkward step after the other until he’s perched on the edge of the bed
With an exasperated groan Tucker drags his shoulders down until they’re laying side by side flings an arm over Wash’s torso and drops his head right on Wash’s chest
Um Wash says
What are you doing
Tucker lifts his head to stare at Wash raising an eyebrow
Uh what the fuck does it look like I’m doing
I’m trying to go to sleep
So should you
Oh Wash pauses
I just I didn’t realize I thought Tucker stares at him bewildered until it clicks
What you thought I was gonna like sleep across the room
Put a divider down the middle of the bed
This isn’t amateur hour Wash
You’re cuddling with the pros now
Wash sort of awkwardly pats his hands against Tucker’s shoulders hesitating still
Are you sure
Oh my god Tucker groans dropping his head back to Wash’s chest
Dude put your arms around me and go the fuck to sleep before I get a boner
I can only control myself for so long before I start feeling you up
Seriously who has abs like this
Wash’s chest rumbles pleasantly with laughter against his ear as Tucker runs his fingertips down Wash’s chest to his abs then back up again
His arms finally come up to loop around Tucker one hand resting on his back the other tangling in his hair and stroking gently and Tucker wants to fucking purr it feels so good
Go to sleep he sighs against Wash’s chest
Just go to sleep
I’ve got you
It’s the longest night of Tucker’s life
Tucker’s only ever run in on the tail end of Wash’s nightmares before
He thought that was the worst of it the screaming the thrashing the shaking
While it’s a terrible awful heart-wrenching thing to witness it turns out that the end of the nightmares isn’t the worst of it after all
It’s not the beginning either when Wash starts to twitch and toss and turn when he sighs and mumbles and frowns a little in his sleep
The worst by far is the middle after the nightmare has set in but before the screaming desperation has
It’s the stuttered breathing and the hurt little noises and most of all the way Wash scrambles for something anything to hold
It’s the way he clutches at the sheets and the pillows and pulls them towards him holding them to his chest with shaking arms
It’s the way he is so clearly searching for something to find comfort in to sink into to hold onto
As the night goes on Tucker tugs away the blankets and the sheets and lets Wash hold him instead
He starts by giving Wash a hand then his arm then simply pulling Wash tight against his body while Wash wraps his arms around Tucker’s torso and shakes and shakes
Wash had been so certain that he’d hurt Tucker if he tried to wake him up but Tucker can’t wake him up
Not when he’s in the middle of the nightmare
It’s worse far worse to feel Wash shudder against him to listen to the agonized noises and know that he can’t do a goddamn thing about it
But he tries
He holds Wash tighter than he’s ever held anyone in his life and mutters into his hair reassuring things sexy things ridiculous things anything he can think of
Sometimes he thinks it’s working when Wash’s body relaxes against Tucker’s chest and the hurt animal noises stop but they always start up again
When the nightmares peak when Tucker is finally able to wake him up when Wash thrashes so hard that they both end up on the floor tangled up in the sheets and each other when Wash is wide-eyed and panicked and confused with no idea where or when he is the fact is Tucker doesn’t know what to say
There are no good words for when the person who is your teammate your mentor your friend your something is shaking on the floor simultaneously trying to push you away and pull you close
There are no good words but Tucker tries to find them anyway
Do you want talk about it
It’s okay
It was just a bad dream
You’re safe
Words so many words but they are all up too high and they are all wrong
Because the two of them are not up high
They are just two men tangled in sweat-soaked sheets on the ground in an unfamiliar base on an unfamiliar planet that might be that could be home that wants to be home
Someday but not now
Now it is only Wash and Tucker and the way the ground looks in the dark of an endless night
So Tucker does not bother with words that are up in the clouds
Instead he roots around on the floor scrounges for the most basic building blocks he can find and hands them to Wash one by one
Your name is Agent Washington
Your friends call you Wash
You’re on a planet called Chorus
We fell on the floor
Epsilon isn’t here
It’s just you and me
Come back to bed dude I’ve got you
Your name is Agent Washington and mine is Lavernius Tucker
Your name is Wash and mine is Tucker
Your name is Wash and mine is Tucker
His head is broken but he has been here before
There is something cracked and raw and bleeding deep inside his mind but Wash knows how to do this
He knows the steps he must take to put the broken pieces back together the things he must tell himself
He knows which memories go in which boxes and what he can use to anchor himself to the present
Wash has woken up in many unfamiliar hospital beds with the beeps and buzzes and the thin sheets
He is always cold when he sleeps but never more than when in a hospital bed
That’s the worst of it he always tells himself
The cold is the worst part
He can do cold
He can handle the cold
He
He’s not cold
It takes Wash several minutes of climbing the slow ladder back to consciousness to realize that he is warm a comforting weight pressed against his chest
He has never slept so warm before and certainly not when waking up after an event
The hospital beds are always freezing which must mean
Wash opens his eyes
There’s dreaded black hair inches from his face held back by a thick headband
Wash gazes further down as best he can without moving to see dark skin smooth and warm pressed against his own freckled chest
For a moment he thinks he’s still dreaming or dropped into some parallel universe where he hasn’t done terrible things and deserves to wake up like this every morning
He then catches sight of the little window at the foot of his bed and his steel and yellow armor stacked neatly against the wall and he remembers Chorus and the sim troopers and Tucker
Tucker sighs against his chest
Wash can’t see his face from this angle but his breathing is low and deep
Wash’s own hands are resting flat against Tucker’s back and he revels in the feel of Tucker’s skin ridiculously smooth and ridiculously warm
How is it possible for another person to hold in this much body heat
Are you doing that thing where you pretend to be asleep because it’s so like cozy and shit
‘Cause no lie I totally am
How are you this hot
Wash blurts and instantly feels his face turning red
I mean--like your body is just no I mean it’s so warm
Temperature wise
Not that you’re not um
That kind of warm too but I meant
Tucker’s shifting to face him now limbs stretching languidly against Wash’s
He turns a beaming sleepy smile towards Wash and that is absolutely not helping Wash find the right words
I know right
I’m fuckin’ smoking
God Tucker Wash huffs struggling to find some measure of control in this conversation before giving up
Just well fine
That too
Tucker’s smile turns delighted
You remembered my name
What
My name
Tucker yawns then pushes himself up a little so he’s leaning over Wash their chests still pressed together
You remembered it
You remember yours too
The night comes back to Wash then in uncomfortable clarity the nightmares the confusion the way he’d fallen on the floor
I yes
Wash
It’s Wash
And where are we
Chorus
Armonia
Do you know what year it is
Wash has to think a little on that one
Uh2556
Yup
Three for three
Tucker’s light-hearted expression turns a touch more serious
You remember what happened
I Wash frowns at Tucker eyebrows furrowed
There was an explosion
At the warehouse
I couldn’tcouldn’t move
I hit my head and I couldn’t move
Yeah dude
You were all banged up
You’re okay though
Is everyone elseare they They’re fine Tucker says quickly
Everything’s fine
We got a fuckton of ammo too like holy shit
Wash stares at him
There’s something else some vitally important detail he knows that he’s missing something that I was confused
Yeah Tucker says quietly
Yeah you were
Things on fire smoke swirling up to the ceiling
York went to get help
Epsilon is in his head is not in his head is standing in his open palm
Tucker came back for him
Tucker came back for him
You came and got me
Tucker blinks
Well yeah
My radio was busted
You couldn’t hear me but youyou came anyway
You and Caboose
Tucker’s rolling his eyes now
Yeah dude
What like we were just gonna fucking leave you there
Jesus
York can’t lift the pillar and he left to get help Carolina will be here soon Carolina always comes always always always
That’s what happened isn’t it
Tucker says
He’s watching Wash’s expression closely
You were stuck there on that Freelancer ship and no one He remembers now panicking as Tucker glanced around to look for something to move the pillar thinking that Tucker was going to leave remembers clutching onto his arm his hand; remembers reaching for him in the dark of the night Tucker’s arms around him Tucker muttering into his hair Tucker holding onto him and Wash clutching back as if he had any right
Wash moves to sit up leaning against the wall and Tucker follows to sit across from him
Thank you Tucker Wash says
Forassessing the situation and getting me out and forforstaying with me last night
You didn’t have to do that
Tucker groans
Oh god
Here it comes
I shouldn’t have let you do that Wash continues
I wasn’t thinking straight
Yeah that’s exactly why you needed someone here
I had no right to ask you to stay with me
You didn’t ask me
I fucking volunteered
You didn’t have to do that Wash says again
That was veryvery generous of you but
Wash stop Tucker snaps
We’re skipping this part
Remember
We’re not doing this
It wasn’t generous of me
I wasn’t doing you any goddamn favors
I was just doing whatwhat teammates or friends or you know what people do
Wash looks away until Tucker reaches out and taps his knee
Hey
You don’t have to go everything alone you know
You’ve got a whole fucking army here
So Wash swallows hard
So if we’re skipping that part where I Get all fucking dramatic for no goddamn reason
Wash gives him a look
Then what happens next
What happens next Tucker says simply is that you tell me about Freelancer
Wash feels something inside of him slam shut and he doesn’t realize he’s flinching away until he feels his shoulders press harder into the wall
There are a million things he could say here
I don’t have to tell you anything that’s none of your business there’s nothing to tell
Yet
Wash isn’t better
He had known for some time now that he will have nightmares for the rest of his life and that memories will surface unexpectedly but they had hit him so hard at the warehouse
He hadn’t realized just how close he was to the edge or how easy it would’ve been to fall
He knows he knows that if Tucker had left him there if no one had come for him that he would have fallen and he wouldn’t have been able to get back up this time
So he looks at Tucker and tries for the truth
I don’t know if I can
Okay Tucker says
I mean look
I’m not trying to pry or get all up in your business
I mean I am bowchickabowwow but just look
We all have shit we don’t like to talk about ya know
I get that
But this it’s something you still dream about like a lot
Wash nods
No point in denying the obvious
I just think that Tucker shrugs
It might help if I knew what went down
So that I know what to say when you wake up
You said all the right things Wash reassures him focusing on the statement as opposed to the implications of it of Tucker wanting to be there when he woke up
It helps to remind myself of my name and where I am
He doesn’t realize just how bad that sounded until he catches the faintly sick look on Tucker’s face
Okay dude
I can do that
Butbut I think I have to understand why
Wash looks at him long and searching before he nods
He shifts around on the bed until his back is facing Tucker and runs a self-conscious hand over his implants
His fingers ruffle through hair that’s getting too long but he’s always kept the area around the ports shaved
The bandage covering his latest head wound is just above the implantation site and he checks to make sure that’s secure before dropping his hand with a sigh
You can see the scars
It’s a statement not a question
There’s no doubt that Tucker can see his scars
Everyone can see his scars
Yeah
I can see them
Wash doesn’t miss the way that Tucker shifts his hands slowly deliberately moving in Wash’s peripheral vision
Tucker’s hands land on his shoulders and Wash lets out a shaky breath
I uh
I don’t know where to start
Tucker’s hands drift up to his neck thumbs running gently down the two long scars that Wash knows mark the skin on either side of his ports
How about with these two
Epsilon realizes at the same time Wash does exactly what’s about to happen and their renewed struggle is almost enough to break away
Maine spins him around so that Wash is facing the wall and winds a hand in his hair to keep his head still his hair’s too long it’s way too long he thinks hysterically Carolina had told him two weeks ago to cut it and Wash feels Maine’s other hand clamp across the back of his neck below his implants
Maine Wash blurts
Maine
He tried to cut Epsilon out of my head
Tucker’s hands stutter on the back of his neck but he recovers rapidly and when he speaks his voice is steady
Mainehe was the Meta right
He wasn’t the Meta then Wash says quickly
Well
At that point he was
But he was Maine before that
He washe was my friend
My my best friend
He took a bunch of people’s AI right
Yes
I think Epsilon was the first he tried to take
But he didn’t succeed
No
Wash takes a deep breath
He didn’t
I we got away
And then He falters again
Tucker’s hands move from his neck down to his shoulders rubbing circles there and Wash closes his eyes letting the sensation anchor him
I’ve never talked about this before
Not even inwell in the hospital
I was too out of it by then
Tucker traces his fingertips lightly over another set of scars on the back of Wash’s neck
What about these
They look like some pretty nasty burn marks
Right
Those
That’s from when they pulled Epsilon
The initial implantation wasrough so they put a lock on the ports
Didn’t want me to try to pull him myself and do more damage
That’s what Maine was trying to cut the lock
They had to take them off quickly to pull Epsilon becausebecause Wash drags his hands down his face
Refocuses
Tucker’s hands are on his back strong and warm
You know about Alpha
Yeah
I know about Alpha
Tucker’s voice grows more confident
He was the original AI and they did all this fucked up shit to torture him
They gave the pieces to the Freelancers and you got Epsilon
Wash nods
Right
Epsilon was the memories
When they put him in my head I got flashes of everything they had done to Alpha
WeEpsilon and Iwe were going to try to rescue Alpha
Put a stop to the whole thing
But II slipped up
They didn’t know what we knew but they knew it was something big andand they decided that Epsilon had to go
Another pause
Another breath
Epsilon didn’t want to go
Tucker’s hands haven’t stopped rubbing circles into his back and he continues to wait patiently but there’s a tension seeping into the room that Wash doesn’t think he’s imagining
I didn’t want Epsilon to go either Wash adds because he thinks it’s important for Tucker to know that
He was myI was supposed to protect him
We were supposed to protect each other
We You should’ve run Wash
Wash shakes his head and pushes forward determined to get everything out like leaching poison from a wound
The Director called us into a room and Iand he 
Epsilon doesn’t hear him maybe can’t hear him and as time speeds up again Wash watches in horror as his own hand snaps to his hip removes his pistol and fires two rounds at the Director
You should have run Wash
Epsilon breaks himself apart one piece at a time each jagged memory slicing through Wash’s own
There’s Alpha sobbing as they take Beta away there’s Allison packing her things there’s Naomi chasing their little brown dog around the yard
There’s a casket and a flag and men in uniform at the door and
Wash doesn’t realize that he’s curled in on himself elbows propped on his knees and hands fisting in his hair until he feels Tucker edge even closer pressing his chest tight to Wash’s back
Tucker’s hands rub up and down his arms tugging them away from his hair and when he speaks Wash feels the words ghost across his neck
Hey
Hey
He tried to kill himself Wash says before he loses his nerve
Epsilon
He tried to kill himself
This time when Tucker’s hands freeze they don’t immediately start up again and he can’t hide the shock in his voice
Whilewhile he was in your head
Yeah
A shuddering breath
He’s okay
His name is Wash and he’s on Chorus and he’s okay
When it became clear that they were going to pull him hehe took control of my body
Shot the Director and then tried to rip himself apart
In your head Tucker echoes again
His hands come up to rest on Wash’s temples
What did
He stops but Wash can hear the unspoken end to that sentence
What did that feel like
Like I was being ripped apart Wash says then closes his eyes plows onward and gives Tucker the final piece
I tried to kill myself too
I justI just wanted it to stop
I got ahold of a gun and II pulled the trigger
If one of the guards hadn’t bumped my elbow then They both fall silent for a long time
I didn’t want to die Wash says after a while
I know that now
But for a long timefor a long time I thought I did
There was too much going on and we were so tightly wound together thatwhen they pulled him I didn’t know which memories were mine and which were Alpha’s and which were the Director’s
Tucker’s cheek is pressed into the back of Wash’s shoulder arms tightening around his torso and Wash can continue like this
The ship crashed and I was stuck there pinned down in the infirmary
Sometimes I think I saw York I think he tried toOne of the doctors came
Tronosky
He got me out took me to an off-site hospital
Kept the Director and the Counselor away from me for a while
He saved my life
I had a few nurses who looked after me and I was too out of it to realize it then but they protected me however they could
Didn’t they want to question you
The Freelancer people
Tucker asks
They did butmy doctor kept them away for quite some time
They drove him off eventually he knew too much but he’d given me enough time
Wash laughs bitterly
After that I couldn’t have told them anything even if I wanted to
Why
Tucker asks after a moment of hesitation
Wash sighs
How can he explain that part of his loosened grip on his sanity at that time had been calculated
When they told me my friends were all dead II lost it
Partially because I knew I had to but the other partI was so messed up
I didn’t know what was real and what wasn’t
I thought Epsilon was still in my head
Wash traces his thumb down the jagged scar just to the right of his implants
Got ahold of a screw and tried to tear him out myself
They restrained me for a while after that
I I couldn’t eat or bathe orI didn’tdidn’t even know my own name
But you remembered it
Yeah
It took years but I yeah
Wash half turns his head to look at Tucker but Tucker still has his face pressed tight to Wash’s back
I’m still a mess Tucker
I still get confused andand violent and I forget my name and where I am
Tucker sighs lifting his head away from Wash’s back and resuming rubbing circles into it instead
I know dude
I know
Wash turns back around and lets Tucker’s hands knead the tension out of his body
He’s half-waiting for Tucker to get up and leave but he doesn’t
That’s fucked up Tucker says after a while
That they just left you there on that ship
That Churchthat he It wasn’t their fault Wash says with a sigh
Itit hurt for a long time but we all had scars from Freelancers
The day the ship went down everyone was just trying to survive the best they knew how
Carolina had just as hard of a time with it as I did
Worse probably
They still could’ve come for you after Tucker says and Wash can hear the thin line of anger underscoring all of his words
In the hospital
Maybe Wash says
Hell maybe they did
Maybe they tried
I don’t know
I never asked Carolina Carolina
She had been there at the warehouse
Wash has hazy memories of her and Tucker and either side of him two blurs of aqua in his unfocused vision
I’m glad you’re here boss Wash had said to her just before the mission when he had thought that things were okay that they had finally reached a point where Freelancer was a distant thing they never had to talk about
Foolish he realizes now
Still Tucker says stubbornly and even thought Wash can’t see him he can practically feel Tucker struggling to hold back his next words before they burst out
And Church
That’s just so fucked up
Who tries to kill themselves in someone else’s head
What the fuck kind of fucked up bullshit is that
I hate it Tucker says when Wash doesn’t can’t respond
I hate that they stuck these goddamn AI in your heads and I hate that Church fucked your head all up and I hate that your team fucking left you
I hate it
He’s holding tight to Wash again and Wash just closes his eyes and squeezes Tucker’s arms
The concept of leaving someone behind is unthinkable to Tucker Wash realizes unthinkable to any of the sim troopers
He thinks of Caboose clutching a can of yellow spray paint in the snow of Simmons pointing a gun to the back of Wash’s head of Sarge breaking into his surgery on the Fed compound and holding Dr Grey at scalpel point
Of a Pelican diving into the snow of a Warthog smashing through a wall
Of Tucker bending over him in a burning warehouse
I’m not going anywhere
I’m going to protect you
Thinks with a swelling heart of his family
Thanks Wash says and hopes Tucker doesn’t pick up on the weirdly choked note in his voice
Justthanks
Judging by the way Tucker’s arms squeeze even tight around his chest Tucker does
Anytime dude
As it turns out there’s nothing on his schedule for the day except a check-up with Dr Grey and a mission debriefing with Kimball Doyle and Carolina
Wash is reluctant to leave his room and the fragile peace that’s settled between him and Tucker but eventually they have to
You called for help Tucker says to him just before he leaves lingering at Wash’s door
Wash glances up from where he’s snapping on his armor
What
At the warehouse
You said you tried to call for Caboose and me but couldn’t because your radio was busted
You kept your promise
I Wash pauses and thinks back to the infirmary to Tucker’s bright and angry eyes boring into his you have to radio me when you need help
I guess I did
Yeah
I did
Tucker raises an eyebrow
Maybe you do learn after all
Well
I’m glad dude
I’m real glad
He leaves
Wash stares the place where he last stood wondering if Tucker’s right if he has changed
Thinks of waking up warm after having his brain rattled to pieces once more and how he’d thought for a brief moment that he’d dropped into a parallel universe
He wonders hardly daring to even think it if that universe is so far away after all
The look of surprise on Dr Grey’s face is brief when Wash appears in the doorway to her office but Wash caches it nonetheless
Agent Washington she says setting down her datapad
Goodness me you showed up after all
Tucker said you wanted to see me Wash says his voice stiff and formal
For a check-up
Oh she says getting up to move around her desk
So you’ve decided to start taking care of yourself
Before Wash can come up with an answer she’s marching out the door to her office
When Wash doesn’t follow she whirls back around to beckon him
Well chop chop
Let’s go have a look at that stubborn pesky brain of yours
Wash follows her into the infirmary and sits on the bed that she gestures him to reaching up to remove his helmet before he remembers that it isn’t there
Simmons was fixing the busted radio Tucker had told him but he’d have it back soon
Wash sure hopes so
This check-up is bad enough; Wash can’t imagine having to attend this mission debriefing with Carolina and Epsilon without a helmet
How did you sleep last night
Dr Grey asks him as she readies her medical scanner
Fine Wash says automatically
Dr Grey shoots him a nearly murderous look over her scanner
Agent Washington I think that I am going to have to ban your use of the word fine in my infirmary
It is rather useless coming from you
But
Wash clenches his jaw
Fiokay
I didn’t sleep all that well alright
But it was justbad dreams and confusion
Stuff I’ve felt before
Nothing to suggest that there’s anything out of the ordinary going on
Hmmmdid Tucker stay with you
Yes Wash says after a pause
And did that help
He’s skittered backwards against the wall chest heaving with giant breaths
There’s someone in front of him reaching out slowly but deliberately
Not hesitating to touch him
Not afraid to touch him
There are steady hands on either side of his face and Wash clutches at them as if he’s drowning
Hey hey
Look at me
What’s my name
Wash knows this he knows this but he can’t quite he squeezes his eyes shut trying to remember but there’s a voice calling him back
No no look at me
Come on you know my name
He does
He knows this face these hands this name it’s
Tucker he croaks voice weak and parched but sure sure of this if nothing else
Tucker
Yes Wash says quietly
Yes he did
Dr Grey doesn’t say I told you so and some of Wash’s icy reserve melts away at that
Did you tell him to stay with me
No
Once we figured out that you hadn’t slept a single wink during your stay in the infirmary she eyes him again over the scanner 
I told Tucker that it was imperative you sleep
He asked if he could try before I wentwhat were his wordsjabbing needles into people
’ Wash mulls this over thinking
II don’t react well to Sedatives Dr Grey supplies
Yes Tucker told me
Wash blinks in surprise
He did
She pauses
I was under the impression that this was something you divulged to him
It is but Wash thinks back
He’s frankly startled that Tucker remembered that small piece of information from so long ago before he realizes that he shouldn’t be surprised
Tucker has always been perceptive
Dr Grey steps behind him running the scanner over his implants
Wash clenches his fists into the blankets fighting back a flinch
Is it just that the sedatives keep you from waking up from a nightmare
Or something more
Theythey make them worse Wash says
He tries to ignore the warm unerring buzz from the scanner as she moves it over his head
They uh
They sharpen the nightmares
And yeah make it impossible to wake up
It’s hard to tell what’s real
I thinkI think they gave them to me once in Freelancer too and I reacted badly but I can’t remember the details
He pauses
Carolina would know
You should ask her
It would be super helpful information to have for your file Dr Grey says then clicks off the scanner and steps out from behind him
Well the good news is that everything looks normal in here
A very mild concussion though you should keep that bandage on for another day or two
Any head pain
No
Just
I was just a little confused is all
Good
Dr Grey sighs then folds her arms
Washington you were very lucky that this wasn’t worse
The concussion could have been far more severe or damaged your implants
You must be more careful
I will Wash agrees without thinking then sighs when Dr Grey’s glare sharpens
Look you think that I enjoy getting my head scrambled around
I don’t
I’ll be as careful as I can but we’re in the middle of the war and if you’re going to tell me to stay on the sidelines
I’m not Dr Grey says
I’m not because you wouldn’t listen anyway
But I am going to tell you that you need to take better care of yourself
I think it’s time that we come up with a way to help manage your PTSD
I don’t have PTSD Wash says startled and for the first time his words appear to have truly shocked Dr Grey
Wash you have quite a severe case of PTSD
It’s more than understandable given you’re the things you’ve been through
Wash is already shaking his head
PTSD didn’t make me shoot Donut in cold blood he says
PTSD didn’t make me knock Doc around and drag him all over the desert or kill South without even it didn’t make me don’t offer me an excuse for the things I’ve done
I’m not Dr Grey says quietly
PTSD isn’t an excuse Washington
It’s an illness one that we can help manage
You have access to medicine
I don’t want medicine
But why
I don’t don’tthere are other people people who need that more than me
He shakes his head agitated
There are kids here in this army who need that more than I do
Dr Grey still has a rather alarmed look on her face
Wash you really it is vital that you learn to take better care of yourself
You cannot keep going on like this
Refusing treatment for a mental illness because you think it’s something you deserve because you’re using it to punish yourself it’s Wash doesn’t answer her already climbing to a stand and she sighs
Justplease just think about it
I will
Promise me one thing she says and he frowns surprised
Promise me that when there’s too much going on in that stubborn skull of yours you’ll come take it out on me
I can take it
Don’tdon’t take it out on your friends or your lover
Let them help you
Let them try
Tucker’s not my lover he says and the resulting flush makes Dr Grey’s face light up in a grin
Hmmm she says
Well we’ll see about that
He flaps his arms vaguely but she continues
Promise me
I’llI’ll try he says
I’ll try
Good
I suppose that’s a start
She gestures towards the door
Now off to whatever super-secret meeting you’ve got planned next
Just be careful alright
I’m getting awfully tired of seeing your face in my infirmary
For the first time he smiles slightly
That makes two of us
Simmons finds him pacing outside of the door of the meeting room holding Wash’s helmet in his hands
The radio’s fixed he says abruptly
Oh good Wash says gratefully and reaches out to take it
Thanks Simmons He falters as Simmons yanks the helmet out of his reach
It was really busted up
Yeah Wash says slowly
Yeah I know
I couldn’t get through to anyone
No I mean Simmons fidgets turning Wash’s helmet over and over in his hands
These helmets are made to withstand a bump on the head
You must’ve really cracked it hard for the radio to short-circuit out like that
Iyeah I did
Wash pauses but Simmons says nothing
Simmons what
You need to be more careful Simmons snaps
If you’re cracking your head hard enough to break your helmet what hope do the rest of us have
Okay look
It’s bullshit Simmons says shoving his helmet at him angrily
It’s all this whole war thing is bullshit
I know Wash says carefully
Simmons I know and I don’t like it any more than you do but
Sarge didn’t even make fun of you
What
Sarge Simmons emphasizes
He couldn’t even come up with a good joke after you guys came back
Not a single rant about Blue Team’s legendary inadequacy
Wash has no idea what to say to that
I Just just be careful alright
Simmons says Sir
Just be more careful
Simmons turns on his heel and storms down the hallway leaving Wash gaping after him
He’s still standing there helmet in his hands when the door opens nearly a minute later
Agent Washington
Doyle says
Goodness we were wondering when you were going to show up
I

Wash refocuses
Sorry sir
Not to worry Doyle says brightly
Come on we have much to discuss
Wash follows him into the room eyes flickering over to where Kimball and Carolina are sitting
Their heads are bent together over a series of charts and it takes a moment for them to glance his way
Epsilon however looks up from where he’s perched on Carolina’s shoulder the moment Wash enters the room
Wash freezes before pointedly jamming his helmet onto his head and looking away towards Kimball
Sorry I’m late General
Kimball glances up
That’s quite alright Agent Washington
How are you feeling
Fine Wash says quickly
Fine I’m fine
He waits until she gestures him into a chair before sitting
As I’m sure you’ve heard the mission was a remarkable success despite your injury
Wash nods
I heard we got all of the ammo we could carry
We did Kimball says her voice bright and excited
We really did
It’s incredible what this is going to do for us
I can’t thank you enough
Have we heard from Charon yet
Nothing Kimball says
Although I’m sure it’s only a matter of time
Epsilon waves a hand
Let them whine and cry he says
We’ll just be sitting here on our fucking mountain of ammo
So what did you need from us
Wash says gesturing towards himself and Carolina
Just say the word and we’ll get it done
Actually we called you both in here because there’s something we want to talk to you and Carolina about Kimball says slowly
To Wash’s astonishment she exchanges a glance with Doyle
That last Pelican barely made it out
It might not have made it out at all in the hands of a pilot less skilled than Private Britton
That’s twice now that Britton has saved his skin
Wash makes a mental note to thank her later
Apologies Generals
It won’t happen again
Of course it will Kimball says bluntly
We’re at war against enemies that want us annihilated and no one is coming to help us
Of course it’s going to happen again
But it can’t happen while the two of you together
Carolina tilts her head at Kimball
What are you saying
What Miss Kimball is trying to say Doyle says is that it is absolutely imperative that one of you stay in the Capital at all times
I wasn’t trying to say that I was saying that Kimball snaps then looks between Carolina and Wash
I understand that the two of you are probably used to running missions together
But if something were to happen to the both of you then I don’t think it’s an exaggeration to say that we wouldn’t stand a chance
But Wash frowns
But why
Everyone exchanges a series of glances and Wash hastens to explain
I just meanyou’ve both been fighting this war for years and now you’re fighting together
That was our first mission and we’re lucky we got out of there
You haven’t seen what Carolina and I can do yet you don’t know if we’re going to make any difference
You already have made quite a remarkable difference Agent Washington Doyle says
The training you have provided to both my soldiers and the soldiers of the New Republic is quite frankly astounding
I’ve never seen the cadets work so efficiently Kimball says the smile evident in her voice
Not to mention that they love you
You inspire them you all inspire them
That’s no small thing
Yes but Wash shifts
I’m not trying to deny that Carolina and I arehighly efficient soldiers butI am the one who tripped that pressure plate in the warehouse
I should’ve caught that Carolina says quickly speaking directly to Wash for the first time
It took Epsilon and I weeks to dismantle all the shields inside and outside of that warehouse and set up dummy ones
We suspect it’s why there were no guards there in the first place they were incredibly advanced
There was no reason you should’ve been looking for traps when we had given you the all-clear
I appreciate you saying that Wash says stiff
But II still should’ve caught it
It wasn’t your fault Epsilon says earnestly
It wasn’t weI He falters when Wash turns to look at him slowly
Yes thank you Epsilon
Epsilon glances at Carolina
She gives her head a little shake but Epsilon looks back at Wash again
Listen
Wash
Don’t Wash says
There’s no way no way that Epsilon is even considering starting this discussion with him here now
Justdon’t
Epsilon exchanges another look with Carolina and this time he flickers away
Wash takes a deep breath
Okay
You want either Carolina or myself to always remain in Armonia then that’s what we’ll do
Unless Carolina has anything else to add
Carolina shakes her head
Wonderful Doyle says brightly
Well we’ll just keep that in mind when scheduling our future missions
What is our next move anyway
Wash asks and this time Kimball exchanges a significant look with Carolina
Our next move Kimball says is to go on the offensive
The rest of the meeting is long and involved with more than a few arguments from Kimball and Doyle
Epsilon appears again halfway through to talk numbers but doesn’t so much as look at Wash again
Fine by him
It’s late afternoon by the time they all pack up to leave and Wash finds himself alone in the room with Carolina
He lingers at the table watching her pack up her things
They had been nothing but polite to each other in the meeting but there is a new tension between them thick and heavy and all at once Wash can’t stand it another second
I have a question for you Wash says suddenly about Freelancer
Carolina pauses her hand on the door and slowly turns to face him
About Freelancer
Yeah
Wash clears his throat
When I wasin recovery after the Mother crashed they gave me something to help me sleep
I didn’t react well to it and I think something similar happened in Freelancer
Grey wants the information for my file since that’s probably not the last time I’ll be in the infirmary
I don’tI don’t remember it very clearly andI thought that you might
There’s a long pause before Carolina reaches up and to Wash’s great shock removes her helmet
She sets it carefully on the table next to her and turns to look at him
Triazolam she says
You’re well I don’t know if allergic is the right word but you don’t react well to Triazolam
Triazolam Wash echoes the word tugging on the threads of his memory
That’s what they gave me after After that mission where you were interrogated
Carolina leans against the table arms folding protectively over her chest
You you had some pretty bad nightmares about that for a while
They gave you Triazolam to help you sleep and itit wasn’t good
It made it difficult for you to wake up and you had pretty severe hallucinations when you did
You stayed with me Wash remembers suddenly
He squints at her
You in the infirmary
You slept in the hospital bed next to mine for a week
She shrugs shoulders drawn up tight by her ears
I it shouldn’t have taken us that long to pinpoint your location
I just neededI just needed to make sure you were okay
Carolina’s palm cool on his feverish forehead
Carolina trimming the hair off his ears and the back of his neck
Carolina arguing with his doctors
Carolina’s arms strong and sure easing him back into bed
But you did pinpoint it he says
You all you got me out of here
Carolina isn’t looking at him now gaze directed somewhere just beyond his left shoulder
Yeah
Well
Wash reaches up to unclasp the seals on his own helmet and sets it down next to hers leaning against the table next to her
Connie tried to tell me he says suddenly
Aboutabout

Alpha
About the Director and what he was doing
Carolina stiffens her gaze snapping back to his once more
Wash you don’t have to
I didn’t listen he continues
I didn’t listen to her
I should have
Connie was smarter than me so much smarter and I could’ve helped her but II didn’t want to hear it
And I’ll never get to apologize to her
I’ll never get to to tell South He stops swallowing hard around the lump that’s risen in his throat
I killed her
Did you know that
I do Carolina says quietly
Wash nods
I was soso angry
So
Angry
I didn’t even think about it when I did it I justpulled the trigger
He closes his eyes
I’ll never know what would’ve happened if I’d justjust taken a second to talk to her
If I’d listened to Connie or paid more attention to Maineif He can’t hide the break in his voice this time and Carolina’s hand finds his on the table
Wash gripes back without thinking focusing on their intertwined fingers
I fucked up he says quietly
I fucked up and they’re gone now but you’re still here
I’m not going anywhere she says suddenly and he glances up surprised at the fierceness in her voice
I’mI’m not going anywhere
I’m staying here on this planet withwith everyone
I’m not going anywhere
I know he says simply
Wash she says the waver in her voice so slight Wash almost misses it
I should’ve Don’t he says shaking his head
Don’t
Youyou had your AI ripped out too
We were all fucked up
All of us
Still she says and it’s enough that single word
It’s enough
The silence that falls between them is lighter than it has been in years and when Carolina disentangles her hand from his and moves to stand the gesture is not dismissive
She wanders over to the window and doesn’t speak until her back is solidly to Wash
You know my name then
Yeah he says softly
Yeah
Naomi
It’s a nice name
She laughs a little back still turned to him
Hmm
You know I can’t remember the last time I heard that name said out loud
Wash can relate to that
You were cute as a blonde he says but I think red’s your true color
She turns around an easy smile tugging the corners of her mouth up
Sarge says the fact that I choose to dye my hair red makes me a true member of Red Team no matter what color my armor is
Wash laughs and the sound chases the remaining ghosts from the room
He would
Carolina pushes away from the window picking up her helmet
I’ll tell Dr Grey about the Triazolam
I remember pretty well what happened so I’llI’ll let her know
Make sure it’s in your file
Thanks boss
She reaches out to ruffle his hair and he finds himself leaning into it something inside of him aching at the familiarity of the gesture
Be careful alright
I can’t manage these idiots on my own
I will he says but only if you are
Deal she says with a wry smile and starts towards the door
She’s at the door when Wash speaks
David he says and she freezes with her hand on the doorknob
David Fletcher
That was my name
Carolina turns to face him slowly looking as shocked as Wash has ever seen her
He shrugs
It’s only fair that you know mine too
David she says low and quiet
David
Okay
She leaves and the door closes behind her the snap of it soft and final like the pages of a long heavy book
Wash doesn’t think it’s quite right to say that Freelancer is over for him
Not when he can slip back into the memories at a moment’s notice not when he and Epsilon can barely stand to be in the same room as each other most days not when he has to remind himself in the middle of the night still where he is and who he is
Yet
When he wakes up that night frantic and flailing whispering reminders to himself your name is Agent Washington you are the leader of Blue Team you are on Chorus Epsilon is not here when he thrashes himself out of a nightmare and claws at the sheets reaching for something to ground himself something to hold
There is already someone holding onto him
The shock of this more than anything jolts him fully out of the nightmare
Tucker he says when he remembers how to speak remembers who is lying next to him
What Tucker hadn’t been there when he fell asleep
Wash had made sure of this had made sure that he’d slipped quietly off to bed before anyone noticed because Tucker deserved some real sleep after the hell Wash had put him through the night prior
I heard you Tucker says now his eyes glittering in the dark
When I got up to get some water
You were yelling
You didn’t have to
Stop Tucker says with a yawn
Stop
Go back to sleep
It isn’t until Wash is almost there drifting in the lines between asleep and awake that he realizes that there was no way that Tucker was getting up to get water because Tucker never went to bed without at least three full canteens of water by his bedside
Simmons shoving his helmet at him Caboose hefting him onto his back
Dr Grey’s palms slamming up on either side of the doorway Sarge keeping everyone else away from him on the plane
Tucker’s lips murmuring into his hair as the night swallowed them whole
His name safe inside of Carolina’s mouth
You’ve got oodles and oodles of friends out there Agent Washington
Freelancer isn’t over will never be over but he is here now
He is here just him and Carolina alive and okay on Chorus and He made it here
Tucker shifts against him and Wash closes his eyes
Despite everything against all odds he made it here
Tucker watches Wash sigh in his sleep the pink light of an early morning dawn falling across his face and thinks going backwards doesn’t even begin to cover it
Going backwards at least implied travel in a straight line
This however this thing between him and Wash was nowhere close to a straight line
It was upside down and inside out and all over the fucking place
Wash shifts against him soft hair tickling Tucker’s arm and Tucker holds his breath not daring to move an inch
For nearly the entire second half of the night Wash had slept fitfully it was true but nothing nearly as bad as the previous night’s horrifying endless dreams
There’s been a fair amount of thrashing and yelling and jolting awake but they had both actually gotten some real sleep
Which is how Tucker finds himself waking up for the second morning in a row next to a total hottie he hasn’t even kissed yet
Backwards
Upside down
Inside out
Despite Tucker’s best efforts to remain still and silent Wash stretches himself awake eyes cracking open slowly to focus on Tucker’s
Tucker watches those eyes flicker from sleep to confusion to recognition to bliss to guilt back to bliss
Tucker blinks slightly startled at the smile stealing over Wash’s face
Morning
Tucker he clarifies
Morning Tucker says cautiously and he has to stop himself from leaning down and planting an instinctive kiss right on Wash’s forehead
Christ they’re like an old married couple
You feeling okay
Wash nods
Washington Chorus 2556 he mutters almost to himself
Yeah
You got it dude Tucker says and this time he can’t prevent himself from running a hand through Wash’s hair
Wash’s eyes flick over to his smiling
Sometimes Iremember quickly
Sometimes
After a few more moments of silence during which Wash does not pull away or brush off Tucker’s affectionate strokess to his hair Wash reaches an arm across Tucker to fiddle with the clock on his nightstand
Zero six hundred he says falling back
Hmm
Training in thirty minutes
Yeah Tucker says intelligently
He’s completely baffled by how at ease Wash seems
Yeah
Are you uh
Are you cleared to do any training
Wash turns to look at him with a small serious smile
Yeah
I’m clear
All clear
There’s something about the way he says it something about the soft yet sure way the words leave his tongue that lifts the tension from the previous few days right out of Tucker’s body
Good he says
That’s good
He’s unable to manage anything more substantial than that because he’s seriously distracted by Wash’s ease and Wash’s smile and Wash’s body and shit Grif was right he’s fucked he’s so incredibly beyond fucked
Wash yawns and stretches
Tucker jolts because he’s absolutely imagining the way Wash’s knee slides up the inside of his thigh they’re just tangled together that’s all still sluggish and sleepy so it’s not intentional not at all but Tucker finds himself arching into the movement nonetheless
With a final stretch higher this time that was definitely higher
Wash sits up and looks down at him
Thanks he says
It’s the grave serious note that Tucker was waiting for but it doesn’t carry Wash away from him the way he expected it to
Wash is still here still leaning over him still smiling
Thanks
For everything
You got it dude Tucker says
Anytime
Just
Anytime you want to you know cuddle I’m right here
Anytime you want to cuddle
Jesus Christ he sounds like a thirteen-year-old who’d just gotten his first kiss
He is done
He is ruined and it’s entirely Wash’s fault Wash and his big blue eyes and his soft hair and his stupid abs
Ruined
He’ll never be able to bust out anything except sappy one-liners again
Backwards
It’s all backwards
They’re so backwards
He reaches out to Wash anyway
You sure you’re okay
Wash grins and laughs a little a real laugh not bitter or sarcastic or hysterical but a real Wash laugh bright and bursting and just the right amount of awkward
Uh
Yeah
Yeah I think I am
For now at least
He brushes his fingers up and down Tucker’s arm
The gesture is innocent and sweet and yet it hits Tucker like a bolt of lightning heat pooling in his gut
Wash is smiling at him head tilted and expression soft and sleepy and a touch uncertain and Tucker wants nothing more than to pull Wash right back down on top of him and
He’s half-reaching to do just that before he snaps his hands back
Wash just went through a whole fuckton of bullshit
For all Tucker knows Wash isn’t fully aware of where he is or what their relationship is and Tucker sure as shit doesn’t know how to clarify that
What even are they
Tucker has to be has to be sensitive or some shit
The last thing the absolute last thing he wants is to act on his raging morning hormones and do something that Wash is later going to regret no matter what his face says now
That and the inevitable smug lecture from Epsilon if Tucker fucks this up now
Tucker climbs abruptly to his feet throwing back the covers
No
He won’t fuck this up
He won’t
He is going to do this shit right if it fucking kills him
He will not let Church have the last laugh
He will not sully this shining piece of trust Wash has given him
Should get breakfast Tucker mutters shimmying into his Kevlar suit
It takes everything inside of him not to make a seductive production out of it so he just hurries the process up and begins slamming on his armor codpiece first
Like a chastity belt Tucker thinks wildly and his dick sullenly agrees
By the time he allows himself a glimpse of Wash’s face he’s got half his armor on
Wash’s face makes him falter only slightly
Wash has also begun the laborious process of zipping up his suit and strapping on his armor but he’s watching Tucker carefully
There’s something sharp and calculating in his eyes some sort of confusion and disappointment
No
Tucker’s imagining that
He wrenches his gaze away from Wash and jams his helmet on before he can do something stupid like start kissing Wash
He’s all the way at the door when he pauses turns back to Wash with a lifted chin
I like sleeping with you he mumbles grateful that the helmet is hiding the darkening of his cheeks
He gives himself a mental slap; rallies
Tucker does not mumble
Bet I’d like it in more ways than one
Boooooowhickabowow
He puffs up his chest and does his best about-face strutting out of the room and feeling faintly proud of himself blue balls or not
Not gonna fuck it up he mutters through clenched teeth as he plows determinedly through the hallways
Keep fucking walking
Do not think of Wash half-naked back there
Do not
He does
He doesn’t
He soooo does
I am so fucked
By the time Tucker has marched himself right on out to the make-shift track his boner has wilted in disappointment
He’s the first one there so he stretches and does a bit of jogging
One by one the rest of the sim troopers and Federalist captains wander over
It’s a weird morning
Everyone keeps breaking off into twos and threes whispering and arguing and
Tucker is sure of it staring at him
They’re supposed to be doing a conditioning circuit moving from obstacle to obstacle to work on pull-ups or push-ups or sprints or something equally as annoying but no one seems to be paying much attention to the order except Simmons
No
Ali you’re supposed to go to the rope climbing station next not Ali does not in fact go over to the rope climbing station
He continues to whisper with Grif over at the weight rack both of them only half-heartedly going through the motions
Grif has been doing bicep curls with the same five-pound weight for nearly two minutes now
Tucker is starting to get seriously paranoid when Caboose ends up at same station as Tucker to do pull-ups
Tucker opens his mouth to order Caboose to the proper station when he realizes that Caboose is at the proper station is the only person at the proper station
Normally Caboose is the one fucking up the order and it’s this more than anything that sets alarm bells off in Tucker’s head
Good morning Tucker Caboose says serenely then leaps up to grab the pull-up bar and starts knocking them out
Tucker regards him suspiciously before jumping up to grab the bar as well
Good morning Caboose
And how are you this morning
There’s something up
There’s definitely something up
Okay out with it Tucker wheezes between pull-ups
Why are you all acting so weird
I don’t know what you’re talking about Caboose says
His pacing hasn’t slowed in the slightest
Really
Really
" Tucker eyes him for another moment before continuing his pull-ups
It’s just um
Caboose Jesus what
See it’s just that there are some people that have a question but they are afraid to ask it and I am not afraid to ask it because you are not as scary as you think you are so
Here I am
Caboose if you don’t tell me what the fuck is going on then I will show you scary
Have you given Wash a kiss yet
Tucker falls off the pull-up bar and lands sputtering on the ground
Have I what
Caboose just keeps on fucking doing pull-ups
Have you kissed him Tucker he asks in the most condescending voice Tucker’s ever heard him manage
It is a thing that two people do when
No
No
He is not about to get sex advice from Caboose
Surely the universe does not hate him that much
I know what kissing is
What I don’t know is why the fuck you’re asking me this question
Caboose finally finishes his pull-ups and jumps down next to Tucker
Well see there are some people who might want to know the answer to that question because some people might have made guesses on when you would kiss and some people have bet money and
Tucker whirls around to shoot a murderous glare at Grif who is cranking out enthusiastic push-ups
Everyone in fact has adopted a sudden laser-focused on their exercises and because Freckles Shake is a very good story that I would like to know the ending to and because you spent the last two nights with him and
Jesus Caboose keep your voice down Tucker shoots another glance around the track
Does everyone know that I spent the last two nights in his room
Yes
How
I don’t know
Yeah I’ll bet you don’t you’re probably the one who fucking told everyone When Caboose continues to stare at him expectantly Tucker sighs irritated
No
Okay
No
We haven’tkissed
Oh Caboose says
Um
Why
Are you serious right now
It’s just that um
Wash wants to kiss you and you want to kiss him so I don’t understand why you are making me lose all of this money
I don’t what money you’re betting
Tucker suffers through a painful internal struggle before saying How do you know Wash wants to kiss me too
Caboose deigns him with a pitying sigh
Well because when two people love each other sometimes they like to kiss and
Oh my god
I cannot believe we’re having this conversation
Tucker
Caboose claps a hand down onto his shoulder
I think that it would be very nice if Wash were to get lots of hugs and kisses
I give him lots of hugs the best hugs better hugs than you give but he is my brother and it would not feel right if I kissed him on the mouth
But you can kiss him on the mouth
I think he would like that
I think he would like that very much
For nearly a full minute Tucker struggles in silence and tries to come to terms with the fact that Caboose just told him to make a move
Okay he says finally because what else is there
Okay
Uh
Thanks Caboose
I’ll keep that in mind
Now please leave me the fuck alone
Good Caboose says happily and he charges off to the next station leaving Tucker to stare at the place where he’d last stood and tries to contemplate just when his life got turned so upside down
Tucker storms to Grif’s room later night after a long day during which no less than three cadets made passive aggressive comments that he’s sure are directed towards his sex life with Wash or regrettable lack thereof
He throws the door to Grif’s room open with a bang to reveal Grif and Simmons lounging on the bed and watching something that looks boring and nerdy
He jabs a finger in Grif’s direction
You
I know this is your fault
Grif doesn’t even look up
Probably
How big is thisthis betting pool you started
Fucking Caboose Tucker flaps his arms still unable to fully believe what had happened
Caboose came up to me today and fucking told me off for not making a move on Wash yet
I mean what the fuck
Yeah and from what I understand you didn’t
Grif side-eyes him
Unless you were lying
Ino
I wasn’t lying
But that’s not the point
The point is
Grif groans dropping his head back down on his arm
Dude
I cannot believe you
Do you know how much money I could’ve won if you hadn’t been such a sissy la-la
He throws a hand up into the air ticking off his fingers
Five weeks to the day after the armies merge
Bonus points if you guess the circumstances and the position
I had my money on you sucking his dick because thanks for not shutting up about that by the way after some bullshit tragic mission that cuts it way too close
Oooookay Simmons says nervously
Uhhh I think I’m gonna go now
Grif’s hand shoots out faster than Tucker would’ve thought possible and snags the back of Simmons’ shirt
Oh no you don’t
Do not leave me alone in here with him
Grif slants his eyes towards Tucker once more
Simmons here is still in the running
He’s betting that you two don’t get it on until after the war
And that Wash is the one to make the move
At this fucking rate
Okay okay
Tucker slumps into Grif’s room and leans against the wall sliding to the floor
I get it
Jesus Christ doesn’t anyone on this planet have anything better to do
I mean how can I get in on the wager of when you two will finally fuck
Palomo is in charge of that one Grif says without even blinking as Simmons turns bright red and starts making indignant noises
Although you’ll notice that Simmons and I aren’t feeling each other up on the training room floor
We aren’t we weren’t that was one time
Grif shrugs
Word gets around Tucker
Whatever
Tucker hesitates before plowing on gaze fixed determinedly on the floor
Look you weren’t there okay
On the mission
It fucking sucked
We werehe wasI just want to make sure he’s okay before I like jump his bones
Oh wow a voice breathes from the doorway and they all turn to see Donut leaning against the frame with a dreamy look on his face
Oh Tucker
You love him
O-ho my god
Tucker gets his feet underneath him and is halfway to a stand when he notices that Donut is clutching several bottles of table wine in his arms
Those had better be for me or I am so noping the fuck out of this conversation
Oh calm down
Donut flounces into the in the room and sits next to Tucker
Grif snags a bottle out of his arms as he passes
Don’t listen to Grif
I think it’s romantic that you waited
It’s just like a movie
Tucker unscrews one of the bottles of wine a twist top thank Christ and takes a healthy swig
Blagh where did you get this
Private Jensen brewed it
Donut says taking a dainty sip
In what the toilet
In a car engine
Lovely Tucker mutters but takes another sip anyway
Okay look the situation is complicated
I’m just waiting for the right moment here
Blue Team Problems Grif and Simmons say in unison
Tucker throws up his arms and sloshes enough wine over the side of the bottle that Donut squeaks
He sets it down carefully on the floor and resumes glaring
Blue Team Problems Blue Team Problems what about Red Team Gossip
Christ you’re all like a bunch of housewives yapping away about your soaps
Blasphemy
M’soaps are way more interesting than you two knuckle heads dancing around each other like it’s junior prom night and you both forgot the box condoms
Tucker closes his eyes briefly in horror as Sarge makes his way into the room gesturing towards Donut for a bottle
Now listen
The two of you thanks son the two of you need to shape up right quick
Oh that’s rich relationship advice coming from
Tucker pauses suddenly remembering Dr Grey’s absentminded kiss to the side of Sarge’s helmet
Wait
Waaaaaaait
You are getting some tail aren’t you
It’s worth it when Grif startles so badly that he almost face-plants off the bed
What
You don’t know about this
Donut says gleefully sitting up straighter
Ohhhh my god
You don’t oh Grif
You should’ve seen them at the Federalist base
Sarge and Emily just couldn’t keep their eyes off of each other Emily
Emily
You’re banging Dr Grey
He turns sputtering to Simmons
Did you know about this
Well they haven’t exactly been subtle Grif
Simmons shudders
Unfortunately
Love is a beautiful thing Simmons
Sarge says airly It ain’t meant to be boxed up tight
Ha Tucker says triumphantly
Not so fun to talk about his sex life now is it
Grif is still staring slack-jawed at Sarge
I don’t how did this even--
Ohhh okay so Donut takes another sip of wine before folding his hands in his lap
It all started when we were separated
Now as you know when we first got there we didn’t know what to think not to mention the fact that we were all in pretty bad shape
Dr Grey had to
Grif groans
Donut please
Spare me the details
Shut up Grif
Just because you wouldn’t know what to do with that pecker of yours if it came with a series of written instructions and a how-to video doesn’t mean the rest of us should suffer
Sarge takes a swig to the sound of Grif cursing and hands the wine bottle back to Donut
He turns a beady eye towards Tucker
Now get a move on will you
Otherwise the good doctor and I might have to say yes to the threesome Agent Washington propositioned as general act of charity
Tucker isn’t the only one who sprays out the wine he’d just chugged
Grif manages to dose Simmons in a rather impressive spray of wine and as Simmons shrieks and starts hopping around he knocks their bottle of wine onto the floor
The night deteriorates rapidly after that
Tucker can’t get another word out of Sarge about this supposed threesome proposition and in the end he’s only half-convinced that Sarge is fucking with him
Patil and Ali wander past their room and soon enough they’re drinking with them as well and before Tucker knows it they’re half drunk and playing some sort of ridiculous drinking game that involves three decks of cards and the empty wine bottles
It won’t just be sex Tucker says suddenly to Donut an hour later when they are both warm and heavy from the wine and he is reasonably sure that no one is listening to them
Donut looks at him
What
With Wash
Tucker swallows hard
It won’t it won’t just be sex if we fuck now
It was never going to be just sex Tucker
Not with you two
Tucker’s more than a little tipsy so he’s sure he’s imagining the misty look in Donut’s eyes
Pretty sure
Not after Freckles Shake
Tucker rolls his eyes but his heart isn’t in it
Maybe
But nownow there’s too muchit’ll bewe’ll be Boyfriends
Donut supplies helpfully
Tucker groans
No
Not well
Maybe
I don’t know
Fuck
Donut smiles at him kindly
It isn’t like you to overthink something like this
What happened to that strapping young buck from the desert
Why you were ready for just about anything
I know
I know
Tucker scrubs his hands over his face agitated
It’s just it’s Wash ya know
Donut nods even though Tucker isn’t making any sense whatsoever
I don’t think you ever wanted it to be just sex
Tucker nods then shakes his head
Yeah
I mean no
I mean fuck I’ve had too much wine
He regroups
You’refuck
I think you’re right
I just
I just don’t want to fuck this up
I don’t
I don’t wanna hurt him more than he’s already been hurt
It’s quite possibly one of the most honest things he’s ever said and it leaves him feeling both empty and full all at once
He deserves something good Tucker continues
I could be that something good
He’d said those words to Church only a few weeks ago but it seems like lifetimes ago
He had meant it at the time but now Tucker realizes he didn’t understand the extent of his words
Something good he realizes now is more than just a good fuck or cuddle or even a good massage
It’s holding their helmet in the rain
It’s holding someone as tight as you can to keep them from shaking apart in your arms
I want to be that something good
Not long after that Kimball is hauling them all out into the hallway one by one
Tucker barely hears her lecture he’s fairly certain that Grif has fallen asleep standing up and it takes him a while to stumble back into his hallway
He must be drunker than he thought because after what he thought was only a minute or fumbling with his door Wash opens it and Tucker almost falls right in
Tucker blinks at him
Damn Wash
Fancy finding you in my bed
What a nice surprise
He waggles his eyebrows at Wash before realizing that he’s supposed to be wooing him and drunken come-ons are surely not woo-worthy
Before he can backtrack and salvage the situation Wash is squinting at him
Are you drunk
Yes Tucker says and grins when it gets a laugh out of Wash
Well you get points for honestly he takes Tucker by the shoulders steering him gently down the hall
This is my room
Yours is this way
Oh Tucker says and stares at his own door for so long that Wash sighs and reaches around him to unlock it
Do I even want to know where you got the alcohol you were drinking
Wash asks as he steers Tucker into his room and maneuvers him to the bed
Tucker closes his eyes against the spinning of the room
Ummmm he says
I think that’s a secret
Really
Wash’s voice is amused as he bends down to tug off Tucker’s boots
Tucker resists the urge to tell him to feel free to continue undressing him
Yeah
Really
He keeps his eyes closed and listens to Wash rustle around the room and doesn’t open them until he feels Wash slip something over his head
Tucker blinks up confused and it takes him a moment to realize that Wash has located his favorite thick headband and is smoothing his dreads away from his face
Dude he mutters unexpectedly touched
He catches Wash’s wrist fingers pressing against the pulse point
Thanks
Wash’s darkening cheeks are visible even in the dim light
It’s the least I can do he says tugging his hand gently away from Tucker’s grip to maneuver his legs onto the cot
As he pushes Tucker’s shoulders down Tucker can see that Wash has stacked his canteens neatly on his bedside crate and did you change my pillowcase too
Wash hesitates
Should I not have
No dude
It’s great
Thanks he says again because he’s drunk and sleepy and he can’t quite find the words for how it makes him feel that Wash knows his bedtime haircare routine other than I am going to fuck you so hard just wait
Tucker feels Wash’s hand stroke down his arm before the mattress lifts slightly and by the time he opens his eyes to tell Wash to stay he is already gone
Quite frankly Tucker thinks he deserves a medal for all of the self-control he shows over the next week
He doesn’t try to feel Wash up once not during knife training not during the lazy afternoon nap they take when Tucker barges crankily into his room in between meetings not during another long night when Wash’s yells draw Tucker to his room
Nothing save for lingering touches to skin and slow brushes through hair
This is admittedly made a little easier when Wash is called out on a mission that takes up the majority of his days and some of his nights but still
Tucker is perfectly well-behaved when they are together determined to do this right convinced that Wash should be the one to make the next move
He’s also pretty goddamn proud of himself for not blowing up at Epsilon
Granted the two of them haven’t said a single word to each other and Tucker may or may not find reasons to leave the room whenever Carolina enters it but still
He is calm
He is rational
He is the absolutely pinnacle of good manners and high morals
He is
Are you fucking kidding me
Half the mess hall falls silent and glances over at him but Tucker lowers his voice only marginally
He turns to Grif agitated and waves the mission dossier he’s just received under his nose
Did you read this
Did you
Isssurlyfoisullshi Grif mumbles through a mouthful of oatmeal not even bothering to glance at Tucker’s datapad
We’re going on a supply run Tucker says glancing back to the roster
You me Benson Silver Volleyball and Agent Carolina
Grif takes his time swallowing his oatmeal before casting a dull bleary-eyed look towards Tucker
So
So
So
I can’t this isn’t who came up with this roster
I don’t know probably Carolina
Looks like she’s team leader uh where are you going
Tucker swings his legs over the bench and stalks off ignoring Grif’s half-hearted calls
Bullshit he mutters as he half-runs through the base
Such bullshit
He locates Carolina in the first training room he tries
She’s out of her armor one of the few times he’s seen her completely out of it Tucker notes absently and beating the living Christ out of a heavy bag
Epsilon is sitting crossed-legged on the helmet next to her chattering away but falters as Tucker stomps in
Tucker rips off his own helmet as well sets it down on the bench with a slam and holds the datapad out to Carolina
Explain
Carolina pauses only briefly in her exercise to glance at the datapad
Explain what Captain Tucker
Explainthis
This roster
Did you come up with this
Yes
He stares at her waiting for an explanation that never comes
Uh you realize that my name is on this roster right
Funnily enough I did she snaps
And you think that’s a good idea
For me to come on this supply run
She throws a confused look his way
I wouldn’t have selected you if I didn’t think it was a good idea
There aren’t many fighters as skilled in close quarters combat as you and we could use someone on the squad like that
Tucker ignores the small flicker of pride her words bring
That’s not what I meant and you know it
Tucker
I can’t work with you
Carolina finally stops trying to beat the bag into submission
What
On missions and stuff
I can’t work with you
Tucker Carolina turns to face him fully snagging a nearby towel and wiping at her forehead
Look
I know you’re upset about what happened at the warehouse with Wash
That’s not it
Tucker considers
I mean I am I’m really fucking pissed off about it actually but that’s not what this is about
This is about you not listening to me
To Tucker’s exasperation Carolina appears truly baffled
I listen
No you don’t
You completely ignored everything that I said at the warehouse
I told you to watch the perimeter
I told you Caboose had shit handled
I told you not to come because Wash was fucking disoriented and you ignored all of it
Tucker his head
I can’t
I can’t fucking work with someone who doesn’t trust me
There’s a flash of something that might almost be hurt across Carolina’s face if she were the kind of person to show it
I trust you
Tucker snorts
You’ve got a funny way of showing it
Look it was a tense situation
Yeah like every situation we’ve been in since landing on this planet
Tucker blows out a breath between his teeth
I had that shit under control
I had it under control
Would you have listened to me
Tucker falters
What
If our positions had been reversed
If I had gotten to Wash first and told you to stay where you are
Would you have listened
I Tucker blows out a frustrated breath
That’s don’t change the subject
That’s what I thought Carolina says
You still
You could’ve fucked up everything Tucker says
Alright alright Epsilon snaps
Tucker was wondering when he was going to start running his mouth You’ve made your point
Shut the fuck up Church Tucker says fiercely a black choking anger gripping tight and sudden in his chest
I wasn’t talking to you
Epsilon it’s fine Carolina says when Epsilon shows every sign of continuing to argue
Tucker’s right
Don’t fucking wait I am
Yes
Carolina wipes the towel over her face again before looking Tucker directly in the eye
It would have been more efficient for Epsilon and I to continue patrolling the perimeter
I just
Charon’s forces were close
So close to being on us and I thought if I could get everyone to move a little faster then She trails off and Tucker forces himself to stay quiet and let her continue
When she does her words are not what he was expecting
You know
What about Freelancer
Tucker juts his chin out
Yeah
I know
What about it
Then you know Wash and I have lost a team before
What does that have to do with anything
I’m Carolina twists her hands together fidgeting in a way that is entirely unlike her
I’m just trying to make sure we don’t lose another one
It’s the quiet hurt way in which she says it that causes Tucker to falter
God you guys are so dramatic he mutters
You aren’t going to lose us
She doesn’t smile
There’s a knife scar on your torso that suggests otherwise
Tucker’s hand drifts towards his gut before he can stop it
Don’t see how you not trusting us is gonna help prevent that shit from happening again
I know
Carolina gestures at the datapad in Tucker’s hand
But that will
Us pushing forward
Trying again
She shrugs honest and uncertain
It’s all we can do
Tucker stares at the roster for another moment at their names next to each other
Lavernius Tucker Agent Carolina before snapping it shut and fastening it back to the pouch on his leg
I wasn’t trying to be a hero he says abruptly
She frowns at him taking a seat on the bench next to his helmet
What
At the warehouse
With nothing to occupy his hands Tucker swings them awkwardly at his sides before clenching them into fists
When I told you not to come
I wasn’t trying to be a hero
I didn’tI didn’t know exactly what was going on but I knew Wash was disoriented and I knew seeing you would make it worse
He thought he thought I was you at first
It was the armor color
I wasn’t trying to be a hero he emphasizes again when she gives no response
I know she says with a sigh
I know that
Why didn’t you go back for him
Tucker asks and even as the words leave his mouth he knows he has to right to them
I justI don’t understand
I don’t understand how you all justjust left him
Neither do I says Carolina after a while
Tucker wants to push to ask her again why to ask for specific details but he doesn’t
He simply lets the silence sit between them until he can’t stand it another second
He’s okay you know Tucker says suddenly
Wash
He’s
I mean he’s not but he’s okay
Even as Carolina gives him a small smile Epsilon snorts loudly from his perch on her helmet
All thanks to you I’m sure
Ignore him Tucker tells himself firmly the same way he’s been doing for the past week
Ignore him ignore him ignore him
But Epsilon continues and as his words start a dull buzz in Tucker’s head he thinks time to go
Wasn’t trying to be a hero my ass
Thank god you were there to don’t you walk away from me Tucker
Tucker does anyway stalking towards the door as fast as he can
He’s almost there when Epsilon voice rings out again sharp and angry
Yeah go on act all fucking high and mighty
Swooping in like a goddamn hero all for the chance to get your dick wet
Tucker whirls back around so fast that something cricks in his neck
What the fuck did you just say
I said Epsilon snaps quivering from his perch on Carolina’s helmet that you wouldn’t give two flying fucks about whether or not Wash was okay if you weren’t trying to screw him
You
Tucker starts towards Epsilon before he remembers that he’s a hologram and Tucker can’t actually knock his lights out
Take
That
Back
Carolina’s half-rising from her seat on the bench
Epsilon don’t
It’s too late
Epsilon zooms up and over so that he’s at Tucker’s eye line less than two feet away
No
I won’t take back what’s true
Not that it’s any of your business Tucker grits out But Wash and I haven’t done shit yet
Jesus Church
Like I’m gonna try to fuck him two seconds after he wakes up not even knowing his own name
Church snorts
Oh please
Like you haven’t pulled off more elaborate schemes than this to get laid in the past
The shit you used to pull in the canyon
YOU WEREN’T IN THE CANYON
A dam Tucker didn’t even realize he was holding back bursts inside his chest and his yell is so loud that Carolina jumps to her feet trying to insert herself in between the two of them
Alright that’s enough
No
No
Tucker levels a glare at Epsilon dizzy and shaken from the unexpected fury this truth brings
You weren’t in the canyon
Alpha was in the canyon and you’re not him
Don’t act like don’t act like you fucking know me when you don’t
You don’t
If you think I would if you think I would fucking do that to Wash then you don’t know shit
What the fuck I thought we were past this I thought
I’ve been in your head Tucker Epsilon spits the hurt just audible under layers of anger
Don’t pretend you’re some fucking model lover who
Yeah that’s right Tucker says
He can barely hear his own words over the blood thundering in his ears
You have been in my head
You know all about that don’t you
Being in people’s heads
Tucker Carolina says Just
Tucker ignores her in favor of stepping even closer to Epsilon
I can’t believe you had the balls to lecture me on not taking advantage of Wash when you’re the one who fucked up his head in the first place
He can tell he’s finally hit a nerve when Carolina takes a step back her palm pressing hard against her temple
Church relax
Tucker puts a steadying hand on her elbow before whipping back to Church who has swelled in size and is flickering purplebluepurpleblue
Can’t even fucking control yourself enough not to hurt the person you’re implanted in
He isn’t hurting me Carolina says firmly shaking off his hand
He’s just both of you need to stand down
Now
Any other time her tone would have him faltering but Tucker is too furious to care
Tell me Epsilon just how fucked up do you have to be to try to kill yourself in someone’s head
Tucker can tell by the way that Epsilon freezes that he didn’t think Tucker’s knowledge stretched quite that far
His hesitation is only momentary however
You have no idea he says his voice a hard whisper
You think you do but you don’t
You don’t
Okay
Tucker straightens squaring his shoulders and setting his jaw
Fucking show me then
They all freeze until Epsilon lets out a bark of laughter
You can’t be serious
Do I look like I’m fucking joking
Yeah okay
Like I’m gonna give Wash another reason to fucking hate me
Just
Tucker takes a centering breath although it does little to actually calm him
Fucking come on
Show me what was so awful that you had to fuck up his head so goddamn badly fucking do it
Silence
Carolina has frozen one hand on Tucker’s shoulder the other hovering around Epsilon like a child would cup a firefly
Okay she says firmly
I think that’s enough
That’s what I thought Tucker says his eyes still pinning Epsilon with a glare
That’s what I fucking thought you’re a coward you’re just a coward
It makes sense now though you getting all fucking concerned about me hurting him
Seems like you’re the rank expert on that
In the space between two heartbeats Epsilon is there a buzzing burning thing inside his skull
Tucker dimly hears Carolina call Epsilon no before he is swallowed up in an angry haze of memory
They are hurting they are dying and it is all his fault Carolina’s eyes blank and unseeing Connie’s head severed from her body
There is nowhere to run there is nowhere to hide; his house is in burning shambles and as he is ripped from it his body leaves bloody streaks across the floor
The horror and pain are all-consuming and suddenly there is a mind mixed with his panic and fear and confusion and Beta is being torn from his hands he is watching the dog run through the yard he is kissing his wife beneath the canopy there is too much it’s too much everything hurts everything is red
--but when the smoke clears there is something steady there too something calming
Calm is Wash’s river-blue eyes; calm is Wash’s open palm outstretched to him
Calm is that moment in the air twisting and spiraling until even Epsilon can’t tell where one of them ends and the other begins
Epsilon’s brothers were ripped away from him one by one but here is another
They are in a storm a raging howling storm and the calm is swept away in the blink of an eye
They are in a cold metal room they are trapped like animals they should run but they cannot and the way Wash screams as Epsilon rips them both right down the middle will never leave him will never leave him will
Tucker comes to with his head pressed into the floor gagging
He presses his hands over the back of his neck expecting it to hurt but there is no pain
There is only the horror of the brief glimpses he has just seen
Carolina’s hand is firm and steady on his shoulder gripping in the gaps between his armor
Epsilon is a blue blur in his peripheral and he says nothing just pulses in the center of his skull a knot of anger and grief and a black envy
Tucker glances up at that lifting his head off the floor to stare at Epsilon
Epsilon pulls a memory forward of a sparring session in the training room a moment in the air where there were no walls between him and Wash
A memory of something that no matter how hard they might try to regain it was gone forever
You have his trust Epsilon says voice a heavy whisper in Tucker’s head
You have what I’ll never have again
Epsilon says nothing more but he doesn’t have to
Tucker can feel every inch of his grief his longing his fury at himself and what was done to them both
When he leaves Tucker’s head it is a slow sighing thing
Tucker feels numb as Carolina tugs him to his feet
You two she pauses as Epsilon re-implants into her and glances between the two of them
Tucker
Are you alright
I’m fine Tucker says then glances at Epsilon
I you should tell him
For fuck’s sake Epsilon
Just tell him that you’re sorry
You owe him that
Epsilon says nothing only shrugs a hopeless helpless lift and fall of his shoulders
Tucker holds his gaze for a moment longer before scooping up his helmet nodding to Carolina
I’ll see you tomorrow for the supply run
His gaze shifts to Epsilon wanting to tell him that this isn’t over but he can’t find the words
In the end he simply leaves
It isn’t forgiveness the thing fluttering in his chest
It’s something harder something stronger
He thinks of the way Wash’s scream had bounced around his head and feels sick slowing his pace long enough to stop dry heaving
Wash is fine
Wash is okay
Wash was returning from that mission today and today he might finally show Tucker how to throw knives
When Wash glances up as Tucker enters their training room to start training Tucker almost wilts in relief
Hey Tucker
I thought we could whoa what’s wrong
Tucker walks right up to him and hugs him so fiercely that they both stumble back
He buries his face in the crook of Wash’s neck breathing deeply and pressing hard as if he can feel his pulse through their amour
One of his hands slides to cup the back of Wash’s helmet just above the scars he knows are there
How does it all fit he thinks dazed
How do you make it all fit inside your head
Wash’s arms close around him after only a momentary hesitation
Tucker what
M’glad you’re okay Tucker says gruffly when he can trust himself to speak again
Just
Glad you’re okay
I’m fine Wash says bewildered
I’m alright Tucker
It wasn’t that risky of a mission
Yeah Tucker says and after another moment he pulls away and gestures towards the knife
Let’s do this
Wash’s brow is creased in a frown but he nods
Alright then
Their training session is intense and focused and Tucker works harder than he ever has before
We’re here he reminds himself over and over again
We’re alive and we’re here
He finds himself fascinated by the lines that Wash’s body makes sharp and deadly sure as the training knife carves through the air
They fall into the evasion drill as they have so many times before bodies twirling and ducking and spinning together like fish through water like lovers moving together between the sheets
Sorting recovered goods from supply run missions shouldn’t be a problem yet as Wash has come to realize the News and the Feds excel at making problem where there shouldn’t be any
Upon Kimball’s request he relinquishes some quiet time to himself to help whip the storage area into shape
One food fight two physical fights and three hours later the storage room is in respectable shape and the soldiers of both armies are being reasonably pleasant to each other
In spite of this it’s still a relief when Kimball radios him over to the landing bay where Wash allows himself to unwind for a moment anticipating being relieved from his baby sitting duties
The relief vanishes when Tucker and Sarge descend from the Pelican bickering loudly
Wash marvels at his ability to still be surprised by this weren’t even supposed to be on this mission oh my God you just can’t stand the fact that you had to listen to me for the past three days
Listen to you
Sarge stops walking and puffs himself up causing something of a hold-up on the ramp of the Pelican
Listen to you
I did no such thing and I won’t have rumors spread that I took orders from a Blue
Tucker scoffs loudly
That’s the point
You didn’t listen to me
You didn’t listen to a single word I said
Carolina if you put the two of us on a squad together ever again I will
You’ll work together and you’ll like it Carolina snaps who Wash is unsurprised to see looks thoroughly done with the pair of them
Dibs
I call dibs on leader next time
And shotgun
I also call shotgun
Sarge pauses as if suddenly struck by brilliance
I hereby call dibs on leader and shotgun on all missions that Captain Crunch and I are paired on from now until all eternity
What that isn’t you can’t call dibs and shotgun on mission that haven’t been announced yet
Can
Did
You
Their sniping dims to background as Wash and several other soldiers help unload the Pelican
Carolina sticks around long enough to see that all of the boxes are accounted for before turning to Wash and clapping him on the shoulder
Your turn she says jerking her head towards Sarge and Tucker
Have fun
Wash watches her walk off with a weary resignation
He sighs heavily and turns back to Tucker and Sarge
Alright alright enough arguing
Look the faster we get this done the faster we can go eat and He may as well be talking to a wall and is reminded vividly of his earliest training sessions with the cadets
The feeling continues to sit as they bicker their way into the supply closet and all through their cataloging
Simmons shows up halfway through and has a meltdown about the way they chose to organize the fruit which at least gives Tucker and Sarge a common enemy to vent their frustration at
When everything is finally catalogued colored-coded and put away they all head up to the mess hall Tucker dragging Simmons by his arm
Wait
I think I saw a label-maker in the armory if I just
No no and no Tucker says exasperated
The room is organized enough
Jesus Christ you need to eat
They cram around their usual table helmets set on the ground at their feet and wait for the rest of their friends to join them
One by one they trickle in
Donut chattering away Grif slumping in crankily Caboose exclaiming about a friendship bracelet he received from someone no one else seems to know
With each new arrival Sarge wastes no time in telling stories of the supply run that Wash is mostly convinced are fake
It’s light and easy and utterly ridiculous and Wash finds himself basking in the familiarity of their banter
He gestures towards the pasta bowl and Sarge shoves it his way
After spooning it onto his plate he notices Tucker looking at him oddly
What
Tucker starts
Huh
Nothing nothing Wash stares at him for several more seconds before shrugging and turning to his pasta
Okay He can practically feel Tucker’s eyes boring into the side of his head which is distracting for several reasons so Wash takes a moment to compose himself before meeting them again
Tucker
What
Nothing
It’s just Tucker glances between him and bizarrely Sarge for several seconds before turning back to his own food
Never mind
So Frecklelancer Sarge says
I was thinking we need to rearrange the training schedule to accommodate
Wash never finds out what Sarge wants to accommodate into the training schedule this time because at that precise moment Tucker slams down his fork and turns to face Wash head-on
Okay I’m sorry I have to know did you really ask him and Dr Grey to have a threesome with you
Because like he literally would not shut the fuck up about it on the mission and I
Wash startles so badly that he very nearly sends his bowl of pasta flying
Wash grabs onto it and takes a moment to be grateful of the fact that he had no food in his mouth when Tucker asked that question
He turns his head slowly to Tucker
What
I mean I just Tucker has the weirdest look on his face like he desperately wants to find this funny but can’t quite find the stretch
I mean Dr Grey I can see but Sarge
Really
I Wash swivels to everyone else expecting stunned faces and pointed insults from the Reds but they’ve barely glanced up and that tells Wash all he needs to know
He turns furiously to Sarge who looks the least interested of all
Is that what you’ve been telling people
Sarge takes a serene bite of pasta and shrugs
May have mentioned it yeah
I didn’t you can’t
I never asked to have a threesome with you
Several of the nearby tables are eyeballing them but Sarge either doesn’t notice or doesn’t care
You may as well have
Stomping through doors without knocking
I did knock
How was I supposed to know you were were doing that
Making sweet passionate love on her desk
God
Wash buries his face in his hands for a moment before glaring at Sarge
So great
Now not only do I have that image in my head for the rest of my life but you’re telling the entire base that I propositioned the two of you for a threesome
So wait is that a no
Tucker interrupts
You didn’t ask him
Is that a of course I didn’t
For God’s sake Tucker
His voice is starting to reach that high pitchy tone it always does when he’s about to have a total meltdown and he tries to bring it back down to a normal volume
Sarge sighs and points a fork at him
I was trying to do you a favor by telling our men Wash
Aa favor
Nope
The pitchy note is still there possibly to stay forever
A favor
Yup
Sarge takes another bite of pasta and takes his sweet time swallowing it before continuing
I was trying to light a fire under your boyfriend’s ass here so he’d get a move on and light a fire under yours
Heyyyyy nice one Tucker crows and then he high fives Sarge and that’s about enough for Wash
He swings his legs over the side of the bench and grabs his helmet marching out of the room
Awwww come on Wash
Donut says from behind him but Wash doesn’t stop until he reaches the firearms training room
He slams his helmet down on the floor and starts rifling through the collection of battle rifles
Tucker enters the room ten minutes later with his helmet tucked under his arm looking Wash is pleased to see at least somewhat guilty
Oh come on Wash
Go away
Tucker sighs
Don’t be such a baby
Why’d you have to bring that up in the middle of the mess hall
I just wanted to know
And you couldn’t have asked me when we weren’t surrounded by the Reds
I didn’t think it was that big of a deal
Tucker breaks off snickering
He struggles in vain to wrest the smile off of his face when Wash glares at him
I’m sorry it’s just dude you’re just soooo easy to get a rise out of
What
I am not
Tucker snickers again
Uh yeah
Okay
Whatever you say
Wash huffs turning away and letting a stony silence sit until Tucker breaks it with a sigh
Come ooon don’t be mad
I got you a present
Wash snorts still rifling through his ammo
A present
Yeah
Tucker moves into the room until he’s standing across from Wash
On the supply run
On the supply run
Shouldn’t it have gone into the room with everything else
Tucker rolls his eyes
Dude please
Half the reason you go on supply runs is to get the goods
If you know what I’m saying
He winks at Wash which starts an instant blush in his cheeks completely ruining any semblance of him trying to remain stern and annoyed
Wash gives up pretending he’s still selecting a gun and faces Tucker arms folded
Alright what is it
Tucker grins setting his helmet down to pull something out of one of his armor pockets
He holds it out to Wash who takes it after a slight hesitation
It’s a vacuum-sealed brown bag no bigger than the length of his hand and Wash can just barely make out the single word stamped onto it Sugar he glances up at Tucker in disbelief
You found sugar
The pleased look on Tucker’s face is almost enough to make Wash forget his previous agitation
Sure did
Is Wash holds up the bag as if he can see right through it
Wait is this real
Real sugar
Without waiting for an answer he rips open the top of the bag and peers inside as Tucker laughs
Dude what are you gonna do eat the whole bag like it’s
Tucker trails off as Wash impatiently fumbles with the seals on his glove
He yanks it off dipping his fingers into the bag to coat them with sugar bringing them back up to his mouth to taste
It’s sweet almost shockingly so after months of bland food and Wash’s eyes flutter shut as the sugar melts on his tongue
Oh my god
It is
It is real sugar
He lets the moment sit reveling in the sweetness how long has it been since he had real sugar
Months
Years before glancing back at Tucker to thank him
The words die in his throat
Tucker’s looking at him as if he recently took a blow to the head and for a moment Wash stares at him in blank confusion
Surely Tucker should be snickering or telling him off for eating sugar out of the bag like a kid or
Oh
Wash’s eyes flick back down to the bag of sugar then back up to Tucker’s dazed expression
For a moment Wash hesitates frozen in uncertainty before a wave of recklessness sweeps through him fueled by weeks of want and confusion and uncertainty and you’re just soooo easy to get a rise out of Wash
He holds Tucker’s gaze and plunges his fingers into the bag of sugar again coating them thoroughly before bringing them back up to his mouth to suck away the sweetness
By the time he finishes Tucker’s jaw is hanging open his eyes dark and heavy
Tucker’s hand reaches out to snag Wash’s wrist holding the bag steady between the two of them
Do do that again he whispers hoarsely
Just please
Triumph and confusion war in Wash’s gut confusion at the way Tucker is looking at him now versus his careful manner ever since the warehouse
The reckless triumph wins and Wash dips his fingers back in the bag and licks the sugar off of them a third time slower and more deliberate
Tucker makes a noise that could almost be called a moan and heat flares low in Wash’s belly
They stand there frozen and Wash swears that Tucker tightens his grip on Wash’s wrist and starts to lean in closer and closer until he halts so abruptly it’s as if a glass wall has sprung up between them
Fuck he groans stepping stumbling backwards
Fuck
What the fuck Wash you’re so
I want to
Jesus Christ
He takes a deep breath and tears his gaze away from Wash and the sugar looking up at the ceiling
Okay
Okay
I need to
I have to just just wait okay
Just
I have to get my fucking head straight yeah
You’re so
God you’re gonna fucking kill me
To Wash’s shock and frustration Tucker practically sprints out of the room
Wash stands there for a while holding the bag of open sugar and feeling equal parts ridiculous and confused before folding it up
Really
The next two days are so filled with activity that Wash barely has time to think about Tucker’s bizarre behavior
He had known things would change after the warehouse had even known that any chance of sexual intimacy was all but lost and who could blame Tucker after a scene like that
Yet Tucker was acting so oddly bouncing from flustered and careful to flirtatious and gentle with such breakneck speed that Wash doesn’t know what to make of it
There’s no time to think more deeply on it other than a brief hushed conversation with Donut in the supply room one day so then he says something about needing to get his head on straight and runs out of the room
Wash gestures with his datapad in agitation
I mean what am I supposed to make of that
Donut is staring at him jaw askew the bags of rice he’s supposed to be shelving forgotten
Wait wait wait
So you were sucking sugar off your fingers and he didn’t jump your bones
I meanit’s weird right
Wash snags the bags out of Donut’s arms and starts shelving them desperate for something to do with his hands
I know it’s been aa while since I’veI don’t know since look I’m out of practice
But I
I just thought Donut is still staring at him with that glazed expression in his eyes and Wash fidgets
If you think it was too much just tell me
What
Donut gives himself a shake
I’m sorry
I just needed to fix that mental image in my mind forever
Wash’s face instantly heats up
Oh Donut
I just Donut shakes his head
Goodness Wash I’m frankly shocked that he didn’t beg you to start sucking on something else right then and there
Wash nods
Might as well call it what it is
So it is weird
Yes but not for the reasons you’re probably thinking Donut says cagily
Well what reasons
I can’t say anything
Wash is instantly on high alert
Wait what
Do you know something
I can’t teeeeeeell you Donut whines looking highly distressed
Oh Wash
The two of you are so dumb
I can hardly stand it
Stand what
Donut grabs his shoulders and looks at him imploringly
Wash
Talk to Tucker
Please
I am begging you
Just you have to talk to Tucker
About your feelings
About your desires
I Wash’s face is turning red again just thinking about that conversation
I can’t
Donut’s distress multiplies
How can you let him hold you during a nightmare but not be able to tell him that you want to kiss his stupid face
Wash makes a noise halfway between a sigh of exasperation and a groan of despair
I don’t know
Wash
Donut gives his shoulders a little shake
Talk to him
Please
I wait where are you going
I have to go
Donut calls over his shoulder
I have to go before I either strangle you or start spilling all of my dirty little secrets
He flounces out of the supply room and Wash takes a somber moment to reflect on the fact that this is apparently his life now gossiping in the supply closet with Donut about his stupid stupid crush
He also reflects however that his instinct hadn’t been to break Donut’s wrists when he’d grabbed Wash’s shoulders
It’s not the sort of shining quality that people usually look for in friends but it is something that Donut doesn’t inspire blind reactive panic
It’s something alright
Later that evening Wash flops down onto the mats in the tiny training room closet stretching his body out as best he can in the small space
He’d just finished some out of armor hand-to-hand with the cadets and had stood in the shower for ages staring at the wall in blank exhaustion
The thought of trekking all the way back to his room where there were surely a crowd of people queued up outside his door needing his opinion on this or his assistance on that is too exhausting a prospect to bear
Far better to take a quick doze here first
Ten minutes
Ten minutes and a strong cup of coffee with sugar is all he needs and he’ll be good as new
This is as good a place as any and no one will come looking for him in here
His room may as well be the war meeting room this days and if he can just rest his eyes for ten minutes he’ll stop wanting to rip all his hair out every time someone asks his opinion on something
He bolts upright again less than two minutes later as the door swings open to reveal Tucker standing there backlit by the lights streaming in from the training room proper
Oh good
There you are
I’ve been looking everywhere for you Palomo thought he saw you go in here
I have to tell you something now like right now before I chicken out
Tucker trails off seemingly to take in the full situation
Uh what the fuck are you doing
I’m taking a nap Wash says dignified even though he’s certain he looks ridiculous sprawled out on the old training mats with an old punching bag for a pillow
Uh don’t you have a bedroom for that
With a bed
Tucker throws up a hand as Wash opens his mouth defensively
You know what come back to it later
I have to tell you something
Okay Wash says slowly sitting up and frowning at Tucker
What’s wrong
Are you alright
Yeah yeah I’m fine Tucker fidgets
Promise you aren’t gonna be pissed
Wash pushes himself up straighter eyeing Tucker
That depends
Ah
Okay
Well in that case
Tucker Wash sighs
Just tell me
Tucker visibly wrestles with his next words
So uh I got in an argument with Epsilon the other day and he
Wash propels himself to his feet unsure at first of what caused the spike of adrenaline before realizing that Tucker said Epsilon
Not Church Epsilon
What happened
Tucker’s talking faster now looking slightly alarmed at the way Wash leapt up
He was just being such a dick accusing me of all this bullshit you know like fucking with your head and shit and I said well I guess you’d know since you’re the goddamn expert on that and I told him to show me you know what happened to him so I could like understand how someone could do that to another person and
 and he did
Tucker fidgets clearing his throat
So
So that’s what happened
Wash blinks at him as the silence stretches on before sighing
Oh Tucker
I know I know Wash finds himself reaching out to place the back of his hand against Tucker’s forehead before he realizes the absurdity of the gesture and snatches it back
Are you okay
What
Oh yeah
Tucker brushes his own hand absently through his hair
You mean my head and shit
Yeah I’m fine
It didn’t hurt or anything and I think he like made it less intense or something
It was just
 pictures
Like movie clips
Wash sighs
He shouldn’t have done that and you shouldn’t have baited him
I know I just he’s supposed to be my friend ya know
I just wanted to understand
Do you
Tucker looks at him hard
No
I mean yes
I mean
I guess I understand thatthat no one can understand except you two
He pauses looking faintly pleased with himself
Goddamn that was deep as fuck
Wash smiles slightly
Very astute Tucker
Now Tucker looks suspicious
Okay you’re freaking me out
I thought you were gonna lose it
Wash sighs scrubbing a hand through his hair
I meanI think to be angry I’d have to be surprised and I’m not
Surprised that I asked or surprised that he showed me
Both
Wash shrugs and tries to smile again to let Tucker know it’s okay but Tucker is still looking apprehensive
I justI felt like you should know
I mean if we’re going toif you want toit just felt shitty to not tell you what I’ve seen
Wash still doesn’t know exactly what Tucker has seen but he doesn’t ask
A part of him doesn’t think he can bear to hear the answer but the other part thinks that it doesn’t matter
Whatever it was it wasn’t good
Whatever it was Tucker’s still here
Did you see me
Wash asks instead waving his hands vaguely
I mean
Did you see my face what I looked like
Iyeah
Yeah I saw you
I was pretty good looking right
Wash jokes desperate to make light of the situation desperate not to frighten Tucker off any more than he probably already has been
Before all the  He gestures at the scars the lines the dark circles
Tucker looks at him and laughs a brief incredulous sound
Dude
You’re fucking gorgeous
Wash’s eyes fly open wide unsure of why he feels as if he’s just taken a punch to the face
Uhoh
Thanks Tucker
Tucker ducks his head and shrugs jamming his hands into his pockets
Like
I’m just saying
He clears his throat glancing around
So anyway
Why are you taking a nap in here instead of your own room
Wash sighs
The problem is that everyone knows where my room is
Tucker stares at him
And
And I can’t nap in there
Not without someone knocking on the door every few seconds
Okaywhy is everyone pounding on your door
Wash shrugs
Mission plans training advice the Feds and News are brawling in the mess hall Sarge is wasting ammo againyou name it
That’s not fair Tucker says and something in Wash swells at the indignation in his voice
They’re running you ragged
I’ll yell at some people tell them to back off
No it’s okay Wash says
I get it we’re in the middle of a war and it’s all hands on deck
Okay but you need to sleep
You’re not good to anyone walking around like a zombie
Hence why I’m here
Wash gestures at his backshift bed
I just thoughtten minutes is all I need
Ten minutes
Jesus fuck Wash
When was the last time you really slept
I do sleep every night you know
Tucker rolls his eyes
Yeah I’ve seen that shit
Dozing off in ten minute increments isn’t sleeping
C’mon you need some real sleep
I’m just going to nap right here it’s fine
Wash it can’t be humanly possible to take a comfortable nap on these mats
I’m telling you I’m not going to get any sleep in my own room
Well Tucker says with a shrug there’s a pretty obvious solution to that
There is
Tucker looks at him as if he’s being deliberately obtuse
Sure
You can come nap in my room
Wash freezes in the midst of folding the training mats back up neatly
Surely he’s imagining the way the space suddenly feels like there’s a closed circuit running through it
Nap in your room
Yup Tucker says ducking into the closet
I think you’ll feel nice and rested after a nap in there
Wash shifts the training mats a little to the left and then a little to the right wishing he had a way to make his nervous shuffling less obvious before giving up
It’s the first real innuendo Tucker has made in weeks and it has him feeling oddly brave
Just talk to him Donut’s voice whispers and Wash steels himself
Tucker he says and turns to look Tucker full in the face
What doesTucker
What does that mean
The expression on Tucker’s face shifts and Wash is reminded suddenly and vividly of the first time he’d leapt out of a helicopter in basic
He’d glanced around at his squad and seen more emotions on their faces than he could ever remember seeing on any one face before fear of the fall and joy in the flight and the strange bewilderment that came with seeing the ground at this height
He watches those things in Tucker’s face now before he sees them steady melting to some new expression that Wash can’t quite name
It can mean whatever you want it to mean
It can mean that you can go sleep while I guard the door
It could mean that we take the world’s best fucking nap together again because you look like you could use a cuddle buddy like all the time
It could mean I give you another A-plus massage
Or and Tucker’s stepping in closer now Or it can mean that we go back to my place and I fuck your brains out however you want as many times as you want until you’re so worn out you get some real sleep
Oh
Oh Wash says intelligently after several long seconds of trying to remember to speak
He tries to force his face into an expression any expression that isn’t the dumbstruck one he’s sure it’s currently stuck on
That
Well
That
Answers my question thank you
Don’t thank me yet Tucker says again in the same tone that he’d said those exact words in in the training room all those weeks ago when his hand had burned like a brand against Wash’s skin
He’s definitely stepped closer into the closet and Wash tries not to think of that afternoon of Tucker’s eyes all dark and curious and the way Wash had gone back to his room after and thought of Tucker’s mouth all over him
Wash realizes he’s somehow walked himself right back into the wall of the closet and Tucker’s right in front of him boxing him in
He’s leaning patiently against the opposing wall with his arms folded head tilted and lips curved in a smile apparently content to stand there forever until Wash says or does something
Wash swallows hard
I didn’t realize he says haltingly
That you still wanted to dothis
Tucker stares at him for nearly a full ten seconds before the realization dawns
What fuck
You thought I didn’t want to fuck anymore
You can’t be serious
Well
I thought after what happened you might have hadseconds thoughts Wash says defensively
I wouldn’t blame you
Geez you’re really looking for any excuse to get rid of me aren’t you
Tucker grumps
He rolls his eyes but there’s something in his tone a waver in his confidence a flicker of uncertainty
No
Wash says and the clear panic in his voice has Tucker beaming moment of uncertainty forgotten
You’ve just been socareful since the warehouse
Wash thinks that if Tucker rolls his eyes one more time they might actually fall out of his head
Well duh
Who tries to fuck someone right after something like that
What like I’m gonna try to feel you up after you just woke up from some shitty nightmare
Because maybe some people are into that but seeing you like that does not do it for me dude
I’d much rather hear you scream for some other reason
I’m sorry Wash says
He shifts guilty
I should’ve
I didn’t mean to implyall I’m saying is that I wouldn’t blame you if you wanted toto call this off
That’s all
Tucker sighs loudly
Wash I’ve been being careful because I’m trying to woo you
Fuck me man I don’t usually do this backwards
I’ve nevernot likebut you you just He falters and it’s this more than anything that settles some of Wash’s nerves
Woo me
Yes you idiot
Tucker stops and looks at him sharp and seeing and a little sad too
You really have no idea how badly I want you do you
Well Wash says flustered but he stops there because he doesn’t know what he’s supposed to say or do or even what he wants to say or do
What does he want
It’s not easy to strip away the feelings of guilt and expectation that he’s drilled into himself over the years and Wash doesn’t entirely manage it but he tries
He shoves down the voice in his brain that’s telling him that he doesn’t deserve this doesn’t deserve to feel good doesn’t deserve someone like Tucker
He looks at Tucker
Really looks at Tucker right into his curious waiting eyes and he tries to think
His dumbstruck brain isn’t helping interpret the images much it gives him nothing but Tucker Tucker holding weakly onto his hand in the Pelican Tucker sulking during training exercises Tucker placing a sugar bowl in front of him Tucker’s dreads spilling over his shoulders as he removes his helmet Tucker’s steady hands on his face in the dark Tucker’s face inches from his own in training Tucker laughing Tucker Tucker Tucker
The realization comes sweet and slow warming his veins like fine wine
There was never any actual brain damage Wash realizes at least not to his sex drive no magical switch that Tucker had flipped
There was only this the feeling of want after years of not feeling safe enough to let himself have it
The feeling of safety after years of needing walls at his back and eyes on all the exits
There is only Tucker boxing him into this tiny closet and it’s only now that Wash realizes he feels anything but trapped
He feels safe here with Tucker
He wants Tucker to box him in
If you want
Wash stops tries again feeling ridiculous but pushing forward anyway
If you want me so badly then come over here and do something about it
His words are halting and awkward but he doesn’t regret them not when it makes Tucker’s whole face light up not when it draws Tucker towards him like a magnet
Tucker lifts a hand and rests it along the side of Wash’s jaw running his thumb over the cheekbone
Wash’s eyes close of their own accord and he brings his own hand up to rest on the back of Tucker’s
When he opens his eyes again Tucker’s face is inches from his own his next words ghosting across Wash’s lips
Make me
The heat that had started boiling in Wash’s belly back in the training room flares to life again
For a few moments neither of them move frozen in the last few inches breathing into each other’s space before Wash closes the gap and presses his lips to Tucker’s
A rainstorm lights up in his brain all flicker-lights and drums beating away from the inside out
It’s the good kind of beating thunderclaps and heartbeats and wooden dance shoes on an oak floor and there is a heat behind each brush of their lips that threatens to spill over and drown them both
Tucker’s mouth is as warm as the rest of him and when he pulls back Wash finds himself following to kiss him again
He’s still sleeping after all
He’s definitely still sleeping because this can’t be real the way Tucker is cupping his face like it’s something precious Tucker’s lips so soft and full Tucker’s knees pressed up against his
It isn’t real
It can’t be real
It’s the most real thing he’s ever felt
This could be a good experiment Tucker says when they finally pause for breath panting into each other’s space
Maybe sex will actually get you to sleep through the night in which case we should probably do it all the time
You know
For science
An experiment Wash says and he can’t hide the stupid ridiculous grin on his face
For science
Yeah Tucker says dropping his forehead against Wash’s
It’s uh
It’s a chemical
Oxytocin
Or something
Or something Wash echoes because it’s all he can do now to echo Tucker’s words back at him
His ability to form coherent sentences left the building the second Tucker stepped close enough to touch close enough to smell
Or Tucker whispers his breath ghosting across Wash’s lips again
Or just whatever
I just fucking want you god so bad I
Then Tucker’s mouth is on his again the heat that they had both been holding back surging forward fusing them together knees and hips and chest and lips
Tucker presses forward so quickly that they stumble and he has to place a hand on the wall by Wash’s head to steady them both
Wash curls his hands in Tucker’s t-shirt pulling him closer until there’s no more space between the two of them and he’s pressed flush between Tucker and the wall
Tucker’s tongue is in his mouth and his hands are under Tucker’s shirt and everything is burning burning burning
Tucker gets both of his hands in Wash’s hair and tugs gently from roots to tips before plunging his hands back in and doing it again
Your fucking hair Tucker mumbles for some reason but his lips are right on Wash’s ear when he says it and Wash thinks right come back to it later
Tucker pulls back and the loss of his body heat is so sudden and startling that Wash actually whimpers before he can stop himself from making such a ridiculous noise
Tucker’s eyes widen at the sound before he mutters Goddammit and Wash finds himself shoved back into the wall again with Tucker’s tongue in his mouth for another minute before Tucker pulls away dragging Wash with him this time
We gotta go Tucker says hoarsely half-dragging them out of the closet
Given that he’s also trying to bite Wash’s ear while doing so they don’t get very far
We gottagotta go
We can’t fuck here
We can fuck here Wash insists and as Tucker pulls back to look at him incredulous Wash realizes what’s so backwards about this situation he should be the one hustling them off to somewhere more private and Tucker should be the one trying to convince him to fuck in the training room
They both grin at each other and Wash can see that Tucker’s realized it too
No we can’t
There’s no condoms in here
We need condoms
Like lots of fucking condoms
Hmmm Wash says and he reaches down between them to squeeze Tucker’s hardening cock through his fatigues
I can get you off without a condom
Tucker groans back arching as he rolls his hips into Wash’s hand
What the fuck Wash he gasps and they spend several more minutes in the closet Wash nipping at Tucker’s neck and stroking Tucker through his pants until Tucker’s pawing at his shoulders
Wash
Wash
My room
Condoms
Lube
Now
Wash breaks away struggling to get ahold of himself
Tucker’s right
With the way this is going they are probably going to need the condoms
He’s admittedly reluctant to leave this closet this magical closet for a world where fifteen cadets are going to need his assistance and Grif has probably lit the kitchen on fire and Kimball and Doyle are going to need his advice and Tucker is going to step into the light and look at him and realize that Wash is a total mess who hasn’t had sex in five years
Tucker must see something on his face because he frowns and presses a kiss so gentle to the corner of Wash’s jaw that Wash feels a lump in his throat
Christ he can’t deal with having this many emotions in such a short time span he’s going to explode
Hey
What’s up
Wash gives himself a little shake
I justthink we’re gonna make it to your room without any interruptions
Oh trust me Tucker says grimly
I will make sure there are no interruptions
He takes a hold of Wash’s wrist and begins marching down the hall
It’s dinnertime thank God so a good portion of the base is in the mess hall
They studiously avoid that section and Tucker orders a few cadets out of the way before they’re rounding the corner to Blue Team’s hallway and Tucker fumbles the door to his room open
The second the door closes behind them Tucker’s got him backed up against it his hands in Wash’s hair again
Wash gasps as Tucker tugs his bottom lip between his teeth and sucks hard
Tucker breaks the kiss long enough to yank Wash’s shirt over his head
Wash returns the favor and then they’re pressed together from hips to shoulders and the sudden warmth of skin on skin is so intense that Wash sways a little
Tucker presses him harder into the door when he feels Wash stumble steadying him and everything in the room tilts and shifts with a sense of unreality and Wash wonders for the briefest of moments if this is really happening
The doubts that had crept in during their dash from the supply closet haven’t entirely gone away and Wash is struck with a sudden desire to make sure that this is what Tucker wants
Tucker said he wants him but the words were like something out of a dream and he has to make sure he has tohe has to Wash reluctantly breaks the kiss and tilts his head upwards panting
Tucker Tucker just moves his lips to Wash’s neck and the kisses are hot and wet and full of tongue and teeth he’s got his teeth on Wash’s ear and his leg between Wash’s thighs
Wash’s hips jolt forward of their own accord and he can’t think he can’t breathe Tucker’s hands are everywhere and Wash can’t
Tucker he gasps Tucker w-wait
Tucker stop sucking on his neck and pulls back eyebrows furrowed
What
What’s wrong
His thigh is still pressed up against Wash’s cock and Wash realizes he hasn’t stopped grinding desperately on Tucker’s leg
I um
I um
’ Wash says intelligently
He forces himself to stop staring at the way Tucker’s biting his lip but he can’t stop the helpless roll of his hips
I
Um
I just I
Are you sure you want to with me I Tucker’s laughs and it’s a breathy thing
He drops his forehead against Wash’s
Dude
Is that what’s up
He finds Wash’s hands and tangles their fingers together dragging Wash’s palm down to his own cock and god he’s so hard Tucker’s so hard and Wash is going to lose his goddamn mind right here and now
Uh fuck yeah I want you
You need to hear me say it again
I’ll say it again
I’ll scream it from the fucking rooftops
I want you
Fuck I want you I want you I want you I
Wash kisses him palming Tucker’s cock through his pants
The sound that Tucker makes is just unreal as he presses himself harder into Wash’s hand
Wash moves his hand up and down Tucker’s length and Tucker just starts moaning and holy shit Wash absolutely needs that sound to continue
He grabs Tucker’s shoulders and reverses their positions so that Tucker’s the one with his back pressed to the door drops to his knees and starts fumbling with the zipper on Tucker’s fatigues
Holy shit Wash Tucker whimpers his voice a distant thing over the blood thudding in Wash’s ears
Tucker’s hands come up to rake through Wash’s hair as Wash sucks him into his mouth and the movement of his hips is at first frantic and unpredictable
Wash makes his pace even sucking Tucker down and almost pulling off giving him time to adjust
He shoves the knowledge that he hasn’t done this in ages to the back of his mind and just fucking wings it letting Tucker’s gasps and groans guide the way
Tucker slowly relaxes into it spreading his legs wider and settling more comfortably against the wall
Mmmm God that’s good Wash he mutters
Fuck
Look at me
Wash flicks his eyes up and Tucker’s mouth falls open as their eyes lock the pacing of his hips growing more erratic once more
Oh my God you’re sucking my dick
You’re actually sucking my dick fuck that’s hot don’t stop please don’t stop I will literally do anything you don’t stop don’t stop please Every word and moan that falls from Tucker’s lips sends a jolt of pleasure through Wash’s body
He’s grinding his own hips forward into empty air but his own need is a half-forgotten thing
Wash is too focused on Tucker and the way his thighs are shaking under Wash’s hands and his fingers are stuttering in Wash’s hair and his voice is trembling under Wash’s touch
Fuck Wash fuck fuck fuck if you don’t
I’m gonna if you
Which Wash takes as his cue to suck Tucker down as far as he can
It’s been a while since he’s done this but it’s like like riding a bike Wash thinks which is a ridiculous and filthy metaphor but he doesn’t care he only cares about the fucking noise that Tucker makes when his whole body jolts and he comes in bursts down the back of Wash’s throat
Tucker’s hands are still in Wash’s hair stroking almost reverently as he drops his head back against the wall and mumbles something
Wash pulls away with a pop and grins up at Tucker who is still staring at the ceiling with his jaw hanging half-open
There’s triumph and affection and a desperate need brewing in his belly and he drops his forehead against Tucker’s stomach and wraps a hand around his own dick
He tugs at himself until Tucker comes back down to Earth and makes an indignant noise tugging his hands away
Hnngh no-ooo way
Don’t you dare Wash

I’m gonnagonna make you come so hard
C’mere
After a few more deep breaths Tucker’s dragging him back up to his feet
Wash lets Tucker push him backwards onto the bad he couldn’t resist even if he wanted to and straddle him slowly
He flicks his eyes up and down Wash’s body fascinated
Fuck dude like your abs I could just lick them
Which he proceeds to do running the flat of his tongue up Wash’s abs
Wash gasps and jolts a little and Tucker glances back up at him
So fucking ticklish
I ah yeah Wash gasps then drops his head back against the pillow as Tucker licks his abs again making the most ridiculous slurping noise as he does so
But it feels it feels nice
Tucker laughs
Dude just fucking wait
I haven’t even done shit yet
To illustrate his point he reaches his hand right into Wash’s pants wraps a fist around his cock and jerks at him slowly
Wash arches up into Tucker’s hand with a moan
He tosses his head back and suddenly Tucker’s lips are on his throat sucking gently under his chin
Wash buries his hands in Tucker’s dreads and holds on as Tucker presses kisses all over his neck his ear his mouth; he’s pressing himself into Tucker’s hand but the pacing is maddeningly slow too slow to actually get him off
He lets out a series of desperate whimpers as Tucker brushes his thumb back and forth over the tip of Wash’s cock and Tucker pulls back grinning
You like that Wash
Wash spends several seconds trying to remember how to speak before giving up and making a strangled noise of assent
He moves his hips a little faster trying to get Tucker to speed up but Tucker just slows down even more and holy fuck Wash doesn’t even recognize the sounds that are coming out of his mouth anymore
Look at you so fucking wound up Tucker mumbles into his neck
Gonna come again just from listening to you goddammit Wash
Wash arches up frantically when Tucker slides his hand away too far gone to feel self-conscious about the noise he makes
Everything is hot his face his skin and somewhere in a dim corner of his mind he registers that his hands are trembling in Tucker’s hair
Tucker’s lips burn like fire on his skin as he works his way down Wash’s body pausing to lick at his abs again
Wash gasps as Tucker tugs his sweatpants and boxers off of his hips and settles himself comfortably between Wash’s legs
He pants spreading his legs a little wider as Tucker nips teasingly at the skin of his hips
Tucker runs his palms up and down the insides of Wash’s thighs grinning up at him before lowering his mouth to Wash’s cock
It takes all of Wash’s willpower not to thrust up into Tucker’s mouth and his fists his hands in the sheets tugging at them desperately
Tucker’s mouth is so warm and wet and the sight of his lips wrapped around the tip of Wash’s cock is almost enough to make him come right then and there
He’s moaning and shaking as Tucker sucks him down and pulls off again deliberate and sure and it feels so good Wash can’t remember the last time anything felt this good
Tucker he gasps Tucker Tucker Tucker
Wash Wash Wash Tucker whispers back with a grin before putting his mouth back on Wash’s cock and swirling his tongue around the tip
It’s so good everything Tucker is doing feels so good and he isn’t sure if he wants to scream or gasp or moan or cry but it’s better than good he’s going crazy he’s losing his mind and he’s never been so happy about it
By the time Tucker takes his mouth away Wash has lost the ability to remember how to speak
He settles for a strangled noise of protest as Tucker leans his face over Wash’s and just looks at him like Wash is the most gorgeous thing he’s ever seen like Tucker’s the lucky one
Wash wants to tell him he’s wrong to tell him thank you to tell him that this is something that Wash thought he’d never have again but he just tugs Tucker back down for a kiss
Fuck Tucker moans breaking the kiss and dropping his head against Wash’s chest
Fuck I don’t know how I wanna make you come
He lines their dicks up
Tucker’s hard again and Wash is going to lose his mind and rubs them together
Wash groans pushing into the contact
God I could get you of just like this look at you you wanna come so bad don’t you
Hngh Wash gasps or something like it
Tucker’s dick against his own is amazing is maddening but the pressure isn’t quite enough and he paws at Tucker desperately
I could suck your dick or fuck you so hard Tucker continues and lifts his head to glance at Wash
No you know what I’m gonna ride you
Like a fucking cowboy
I wanna see the look on your face when you come
Wash brain goes offline for a moment at those words and he tries to regroup as Tucker rolls off of him and starts throwing stuff out of the crate at the foot of his bed until he emerges triumphant with lube and an absurd number of condoms
He tosses the condoms at Wash who fumbles them with shaking hands and almost comes on the spot when Tucker sits up on his knees grabs the lube and just starts fingering himself
Tucker’s body jolts as he groans low between his teeth and Wash reaches for him clumsily the condoms forgotten
Tucker swats his hands away grinning
Later dude
You just relax and watch the fucking show
Ah-ah he catches Wash’s hand as he moves it towards his dick
No touching yourself either
Watching only
Wash bites his lip clutching the sheets desperately to keep himself from jerking himself off or jerking Tucker off or opening Tucker up; he isn’t sure which of the three he wants to do the most
It gets harder and harder to keep himself still as Tucker works himself open pleasure flickering across his face
Wash busies himself by tearing open a condom wrapping and sliding it onto his dick after an attempt to put it on backwards
He squeezes his eyes shut as Tucker’s hand closes around his shaft lubing up the condom because he is not not not going to come from that
His eyes fly back open as Tucker lines himself up and slowly sinks down onto him
Wash presses his head back into the pillow panting loudly and trying to keep himself still
He runs his hands up and down Tucker’s thighs across his stomach over his chest before bringing them to rest on Tucker’s hips
It’s okay dude Tucker says grinning down at him
He splays out his hands on Wash’s chest and starts to move
Go fucking crazy
Wash thrusts up into him gratefully and Tucker throws back his head and groans
Goddamn Wash he hisses
Mm yeah just like that do that again The rhythm they set is firm and steady Wash’s hands squeezing into Tucker’s hips as he slides up and down Wash’s dick
It’s good it’s so good and Tucker is gorgeous his movements confident and sure
Wash loses himself in the sensation in the steadiness and overwhelming pleasure the so-good so-good so-good pounding in his head like a drum
It’s been too long and Wash doesn’t last more than a few minutes but it’s long enough for Tucker to wrap a hand around his own dick groaning and clenching around Wash as he comes again in between the two of them
The look on his face is all it takes
Wash comes hard and he isn’t sure if two minutes pass or two days or two years all he knows is that he’s losing his mind he can’t think can’t comprehend anything but Tucker Tucker Tucker
Tucker rolls off of him to stare open-mouthed up at the ceiling as Wash sits up shakily peeling the condom off
His hands are still shaking badly enough that it makes a mess but Wash doesn’t care doesn’t care that there’s cum all over his chest and the sheets and both of their hands
He throws it in the trashcan and Tucker leans into the crate again grabs a towel and half-heartedly wipes both of them off until they both collapse breathing hard onto the bed
Wow Tucker says to the ceiling then rolls his head to look at Wash
Dude are you okay
You’re shaking
Wash nods reaching for Tucker
Tucker goes to him rolling over so that their chests are pressed together just like that first morning when they woke up together
Thanks he manages
That wasthanks
Tucker rolls his eyes
Oh man I knew you were gonna get all weird after sex
But Tucker’s grinning as he says it and Wash reaches up to touch the dimples on his face
I can do that now he realizes elatedly
He can touch his face and kiss his lips and Tucker will let him because Tucker wants him to
Wash may be dense may still be half-convinced that he’s walking around in a dream but Tucker wants him really wants him wants to kiss him is kissing him the press of his lips soft and steady the drag of his hands over Wash’s shoulders tingly and electric
Wash tangles his hands in Tucker’s hair and holds him there kisses him back a wild half-forgotten happiness blooming and blossoming inside his chest unfurling towards the sky to catch the rain
It is so very cold in space
The planet where he came from burned with a sun so unbearable that it was often dangerous to be outside during the daylight hours
Expansive and seemingly endless tunnels stretched from building to building with cooling units that ran constantly in the background
Their hum was a dull maddening thing and although it has been years since he’s heard the fans he sometimes finds himself twisting and turning to find the source of the drone inside his head
Memory
Only memory
As a child he used to dream of green
Lush grass expansive forests bright leaves and petals and blue water
Cool colors
Soothing colors
Any colors other than the browns and oranges and reds of his youth
Space did not bring him green but it did bring him an endless inky black broken only by the white light of the stars
Space was relief from the harsh climate of his youth
It was dark
It was empty
It was blessedly gloriously cold
He still finds himself staring out windows transfixed by the pale distance of the stars
They help him think
There were patterns in the stars if only he could see them
When the door opens behind him he does not turn
He waits he is if nothing else a patient man and sure enough his visitor is silent for mere moments before speaking
Sooo
Aiden-fucking-Price
Is that your real name
Price waits another several seconds before turning to face his visitor
Is Felix yours
Felix snorts
Of course not
What do you think I’m fucking idiot
Quite
Is there something I can help you with Felix
You can start by giving us some useful information on how to take these fuckers out
Felix has either forgotten his initial question or he never truly cared for the answer in the first place
Regardless it is foolish allowing Price to dictate the conversation this early in the game
It seems they are proving themselves quite worthy opponents
What no they’re not
They’re just Felix visibly struggles to find words worthy enough to express his agitation before tossing his hands in the air
It’s these fucking Freelancers and these sim troopers
Christ we never had a problem playing this planet like a goddamn fiddle until they showed up
They are heroes to these people
Price glances out the window again
Patterns in the starlight so many patterns
I highly doubt that the sudden insurgence in victories has anything to do with their skill as soldiers so much as it does their ability to boost this planet’s morale
Yeah well they’re certainly kicking our asses enough in battle to make me doubt that fucking analysis
Felix pauses
The Freelancers I mean
The Reds and Blues are a fucking joke
I would argue that it is mostly the Simulation Troopers who
Are you fucking serious
Oh man you should take Locus out to dinner sometime
The two of you could sit and jerk each other off thinking about the darling sim troopers
I merely think that the morale the Red and Blue soldiers have
Oh my God I don’t care
It wasn’t a fucking sim trooper who took down all our shields at that gun warehouse or rendered my fucking shoulder useless for two days at the way station last week
Felix scowls at the memory
I want to know how to take these Freelancers out
The Counselor has already given us information on the Freelancers and their weaknesses
They turn to see Locus standing just inside the doorway as if he’s been there all along
For all Price knows he has been
Impressive
He didn’t even hear Locus’s approach unlike Felix who stomps through the corridors just because he can
Felix has made clear his opinion of Price’s insights abundantly clear; in all of his work with elite soldiers Price has never before met one with Felix’s remarkable capacity to display genuine feeling with such alacrity
He told us that Agent Carolina is a touch too competitive Felix says now the dismissive tone in his voice all too clear
Like that’s a big surprise and that Washington is a big crybaby who doesn’t want another AI in his head
How exactly are either of those things going to help us
Locus regards Felix dispassionately before turning to Price
Why does Agent Washington refuse access to his neural implants
Felix groans throwing himself into a chair
Agent Washington Agent Washington
He glances at Price
Locus here has a gigantic loser crush on our friend Washy
Going on and on about how he was such a true soldier
I’m pretty sure he’s written about him in his diary
Enough Locus snaps and to Price’s surprise Felix does quiet
Interesting
We know from the intelligence recovered from Freelancer that Agent Washington had an AI
The Epsilon unit in fact
We know that he only functioned with that AI for a short time before it was removed
What we don’t know is why
Do we care
Locus turns to Price slowly expression forever unreadable beneath that blank helmet
Do we
The removal of the Epsilon unit from Agent Washington’s neural interface was due to Epsilon’s attempted self-destruction Price says
Westarted to suspect that his fragment held highly sensitive information vital to the survival or Project Freelancer
Once it became clear that we were going to remove him from Washington for further examination he took matters into his own hands
Attempted self-destructionso what he tried to kill himself
Felix snorts
Bet that fucked up Wash’s head
It took him years to recover from the brain damage done
One of his clear conditions for working for us as a Recovery Agent was that under no circumstances would he accept another AI
It is interesting Locus says slowly that a soldier such as Agent Washington would be sovocal about something that causes him such distress
Fascinating Felix drawls
They ignore him
Unless it was an act
Locus postulates
A ruse designed to hide a true weakness
It was no ruse Price says
Of that he is certain
It is true that Washington was able tomislead us about his true purpose in becoming a Recovery Agent but his feelings about refusing AI access to his implants was genuine
I would go so far to say that the prospect causes him not only distress but also great fear
As much as I’m enjoying this story Felix says I fail to see how this is going to help us in the slightest
Great so Washington doesn’t want an AI in his head
We’ll just plant another one in his brain for the fun of it
I’m sure that’ll help us turn the tide of this fucking war Price watches as Felix trails off staring hard at Locus before scoffing
You cannot be serious
That’s your plan
I wouldn’t call it a plan Locus says slowly
Morethe beginnings of an idea
Felix pushes up from his chair pacing back and forth
Oh okay
We’ll just pull one of the dozens of AI we just happen to have lying around and stick it in dear Agent Washington’s head
Which will accomplishI’m sorry what exactly
We have information on what one of our biggest obstacles fears the most Locus growls agitation creeping into his tone for the first time
Don’t think we should use it
Listen Locus I’m all for using whatever we can get but I don’t see how this is going to be of any use to us at all
Their bickering fades into the background a low buzzing drone that sets Prices’s teeth on edge
Still it is familiar reassuring even
The cooling fans nearly drove him to madness in his youth but their hum could always be counted on
It was constant unerring
Predictable
I think he says that I have an idea
The irritating hum of their argument falters and Price lets them wait focused once more on the yawning black and pinprick stars
He uses them to chart his thoughts traces their lines to connect patterns and sure enough there it is
Step one in ending this war in getting himself out of this mess
He turns to look at Felix and Locus who are assessing him with impatience
Felix and Locus
Code names of course
He had never understood the point himself
Aiden Price is in fact his real name
When Tucker wakes up it’s to the feel of gentle fingers running up and down his arm and a reddish light pressing against his closed eyelids
He keeps his eyes shut for several minutes longer and soaks in the sensations
The sunlight is nice and warm the hand on his arm tickles pleasantly and he’s pretty confident Wash is doing that thing where he stares in awe at the glorious sight he got to wake up next to
Tucker is mooore than happy to give him something to stare at
He makes his face nice and soft before pretending to wake up slowly scrunching his nose and blinking open his eyes blearily
Adorable
He is fucking adorable
Tucker finally focuses his eyes to see that Wash is staring at him alright but the look is less awestruck and more amused
Smooth Tucker
Right
Tucker winks up at him
Smooth as butter
Wash rolls his eyes but he’s grinning and he seems unable to stop
He’s relaxed and happy in a way Tucker’s never seen and it’s a goddamn good look on him
Tucker reaches up to ruffle Wash’s hair just because he can
Sleep okay
Wash laughs bright and bursting
I don’t think I moved all night
Yeeeeeah I wore you out didn’t I
You uh
That you did
Tucker grins tugging Wash back down for a kiss
It’s sloppy and wet and they both have morning breath but it’s pretty goddamn great anyway
You’re really good at that
Wash pulls back enough to squint at Tucker suspiciously as if he thinks Tucker’s fucking with him
Good at what
At kissing you loser
Wash flushes a little but he looks pleased too so Tucker keeps it up
At dick sucking too like hoooly fuck
It was the build-up Tucker
Uh no it was your fucking mouth
You need to give me lessons on that thing you did with your tongue where you like He sticks out his tongue and tries to demonstrate which accomplishes absolutely nothing except getting Wash to laugh again so it’s not a total loss
It also gets Wash to give him a considering look and say Well I suppose it could be one more thing that we add to your lessons
Tucker sits up so fast that he almost clocks Wash in the forehead
Uhhhh fuck yeah it can
And can you use your ‘I want twenty laps around the canyon’ voice when you do it
And can we do it in the training room
And
Tucker no
We are not fooling around in the training room
Dude
You were the one trying to fuck me in the training room closet yesterday
Yeswell that was different Wash says dignified
I wascaught up in the moment
Tucker snorts
It’s gonna happen
You’ll see
He’s getting hot just thinking about it getting on his knees while Wash tells him what to do with his mouth in that fucking velvet voice of his
Maybe they would be in the training room
Maybe they’d be in full armor and Wash would take off nothing but his codpiece
The possibilities were endless
Man do you know how hard I’ve worked to control myself lately with you strutting around licking sugar off your fingers Jesus Christ Wash grins at the memory before something visibly occurs to him
Is that why you ran off so quickly afterwards
Your fight with Epsilon
Tucker sighs
Yeah
I was just being too chicken shit to tell you
Didn’t want that hanging over my head like a fucking anvil though
He slants a look at Wash
I can’t believe you thought I didn’t want you God
What do you think I’m blind
Well Wash shrugs
I wouldn’t have you saw what I was like andwith Epsilon Ugh Tucker makes a face
Fuck Epsilon
I don’t want to talk about him
Let’s talk about something way more interesting
Let’s talk about your wish list
Your sexy wish list
What
I don’t have a sexy wish list Tucker
Tucker rolls his eyes
I’m not asking for like a fucking alphabetized spreadsheet Wash
Justyou know some stuff that you’re into
Give me something to work with here
Still still Wash does a double take
Youso this really is something you want to do again then
Tucker groans pulling a pillow over his face in distress
Yes Wash
Jesus
I want to fuck you like a million more times and cuddle with you and like hear about your day and shit
What do I need to ask if you wanna go steady
Jesus jumped up Christ Alright alright Wash huffs
I just want to be sure
Tucker removes the pillow and casts a long-suffering look at Wash
Dude you’re sure I’m sure the whole base is sure
Let’s fuck
If you’re not gonna tell me any of your kinks then let’s go back to the part where you were sucking on your fingers because holy shit that was totally working for me
Wash gives him a look
Oh well in that case let me just go grab the sugar then
Okay
Tucker sits up a little straighter folding his hands in his lap
I’ll wait
Very funny
Dude I never joke about sex
Tucker reflects
Well okay yes I do but I’m not joking about this
When Wash still continues to stare at him as if Tucker’s speaking a foreign language Tucker sighs puts his first two fingers in his mouth and sucks on them
He makes it as obscene as he possibly can swirling his tongue and dragging his teeth and even throwing a moan or two in there
Wash stops fidgeting and just stares at him transfixed until Tucker pulls his mouth away and grins
See
It’s not that hard
He cuts himself off startled as Wash sits up and grabs Tucker’s wrist and tugs it towards him
Wash unfolds Tucker’s fingers flattening out his palm and rubbing small circles there with his thumb
They stay like that for a few moments Wash tracing the love lines and the laugh lines and whatever the fuck lines they are before bringing his own mouth to Tucker’s palm
Tucker makes a noise somewhere between a yelp and a moan as Wash drags the flat of his tongue against Tucker’s palm then reverses the motion with his teeth
Sparks of pleasure jolt through Tucker’s body crackling inside his skull burning down his spine and he finds himself squirming closer and closer until he’s half in Wash’s lap his legs locked around his waist as he tries to squirm away and move closer all at once
Wash moves his palm to suck Tucker’s first two fingers into his mouth dragging his teeth along the edges and doing that thing with his tongue again
Tucker tips his head back to pant at the ceiling his free hand scrabbling for purchases against the wall the sheets Wash’s hair anything; he can’t stay still and Wash is going to drive him insane
Wash is saying something the words vibrating pleasantly against Tucker’s palm and it isn’t until he pulls away to grin that Tucker’s ears start semi-functioning again
So sensitive he murmurs placing another kiss to the outside of Tucker’s thumb
Hmm
I think I found your hotspot
Wh you did not
Tucker protests
My sweet spot is not my hand what the what the fuck fucking goddammit Wash
It is
His sweet spot apparently is his fucking hand which is the lamest thing in the world except it’s not because Wash’s teeth are dragging across the heel of his palm again and it’s turning Tucker’s brain to ash
He can’t think he can’t breathe and then Wash warps a loose hand around the base of Tucker’s dick and jerks his fist up slowly twisting as he goes Jesus Christ he’s going to get him off just like this just from kissing Tucker’s palm
Wait Tucker gasps his hips rolling forward into Wash’s hand nonetheless
Wash wait
I wanna fuck you I wanna
Wash silences him with a kiss and although Tucker’s palm feels oddly cool and empty with the loss of Wash’s mouth his own mouth is more than happy with this turn of events
He surges forward so quickly that they topple backwards Tucker landing half on top
He takes immediate advantage tracing his tongue along the shell of Wash’s ear until his breathing turns ragged
Pinned you
What you did not I let you do that Wash protests but he doesn’t sound nearly as convincing as he’d probably hoped
Suuuure Tucker says and plants another filthy kiss on Wash’s lips before craning his neck around
Shit what’d we do with the lube He half-heartedly pats around the pillows before pushing himself off of Wash with a groan leaning his upper half off the bed to peer under the bed
The lube is nowhere in sight
Found the condoms at least Wash says and Tucker peeks his head up to see Wash fishing the roll out from in between the bed and the wall
Where did you get all of these
Uh supply run of coursea-ha
Tucker almost face plants off the mattress when he spots the lube under the bed straining to reach it
He emerges triumphant to see Wash watching him in amusement
Is that why you really went on the supply run
I went on the supply run because I was assigned to it Tucker says striving for as much poise as he can muster while liberally coating his fingers with lube
And yeah
I had to get me some sugar
In more ways than one
He waggles his eyebrows at Wash who looks torn between exasperation and laughter
Really
Yeah really
He pushes Wash back down so he’s lying flat on his back
Now are we gonna play twenty questions or are you gonna let me finger fuck you
Wash grins up at him all breathless and blushy and so fucking gorgeous that Tucker doesn’t know what to do with himself
Those goddamn freckles are going to be the end of him
He settles himself in between Wash’s legs and hooks one of Wash’s thighs over his own shoulder for no other reason than he’s imagined doing this exact thing every time he’s seen Wash stretching
He runs a hand up and down Wash’s leg kneading the muscles in his thigh before wrapping a hand around Wash’s dick
He gets a few good strokes in and is just getting ready to stretch Wash open when something occurs to him
Wait you have been with dudes before right
Wash whines a little as Tucker’s hand stills on his dick
W-what
Shit
’Cause if this is your first time taking it up the ass then you gotta let me know so I don’t like go fucking nuts here
Oh no
I mean yeah yes yes
Some of the fog clears in Wash’s eyes
I’vebeen with men before yes
I thought you knew that
Oh good Tucker says in relief speeding up his hand again
I mean that’s cool if you haven’t I just wanted to check
‘Cause like you mentioned fucking that girl back in Freelancer but you never actually said anything about riding any dicks so
Tucker Wash groans throwing an arm over his eyes as he rocks more insistently into Tucker’s hand
Can we not
Oh
Right
Maybe not the best idea to bring up the dead ex-fuck buddy of the dude you’re currently trying to bang
Shit my bad
Forget I mentioned that
Just focus on the handie I’m giving you here
I’m trying
I’ve fucked dudes before too Tucker says conversationally
Not like a lot but I know my way around a dick
I’ve noticed Wash groans and then his hips do a forward-back-forward-back thrusting thing as Tucker wriggles a lubed-up finger inside of him
Ohhh fuck Just like enough to get stuff done Tucker pants but he’s starting to lose the thread of the conversation as Wash goes to pieces underneath him
To uhJesus Wash He grinds his own dick down against the mattress as Wash lets out a shaky moan and claps a hand over his mouth to stifle the sound
Tucker works in a second finger angles his wrist and curls his fingers hard
He grins in delight as Wash’s back practically arches off the bed and he claps his other hand over his mouth as well
Wash he groans
Washget your fucking hands back downI wanna hearall of these noises
Wash does bring his hands back down to tangle in Tucker’s hair although he grits his teeth hard as Tucker curls his fingers again
Tucker
I
I
Oh shit you ready dude
Ohh fuck okay you got the condoms good rip one off for me my hand’s all lubed up Tucker keeps on stretching him open as Wash fumbles with the condom finally ripping one open and tossing the rest aside
His hands are shaking slightly as he moves to hand it to Tucker and promptly drops it as Tucker gets a third finger in there
Shit sorry shit shit shit
Wash pats around blindly for the dropped condom and thrusts it at Tucker
Here here
Someone’s eager Tucker says with a snicker as he pulls his fingers out and fumbles the condom on his dick and lines himself up at Wash’s entrance
Hmm
Maybe I should call you butterfingers
Hnngh do not
Then Wash stops talking and Tucker stops thinking and they both start doing a whole lot of gasping and panting because Wash is so tight and he feels so good and he wraps his hands in Tucker’s hair and tugs hard
He hesitates when Tucker moans so loudly it almost echoes and Tucker presses his head into Wash’s hand
Didn’t hurt he whines thrusting in deep and circling there
Do do that again
Wash obliges winding his fingers through Tucker’s dreads and pulling juuuust hard enough
He keeps it up for a while until Tucker moves his hips faster and Wash clutches hard at Tucker’s shoulders the wall the sheets beneath them
Is it is it too much
Tucker pants between thrusts
No no it’s it’s it’s good it’s oh God God God Wash trails off into a wordless gasp that turns into a moan his hand flying up to cover his mouth
When that’s not quite enough to stifle the sounds he grabs a pillow and smashes it over his face
Tucker laughs breathlessly tugging the pillow away
Uh-uhdon’t you daredeprive me of thesethese fucking noises you’re making
When Wash is bringing a hand back up to his mouth again a few seconds later Tucker catches his wrist and pins it gently to the bed
He tangles their fingers together keeping the pressure light and reassuring but to his surprise Wash gasps as if he’s been electrocuted his hips rolling up even harder to meet Tucker’s
Holy fuck
Tucker reaches for Wash’s other wrist and secures that one over their heads as well giving Wash’s hands a squeeze and yup Tucker can definitely get behind this plan
He can see every inch of Wash’s arms like this stretched out over his head in all their chiseled glory
Wash lets out a particularly loud moan when Tucker thrusts in deep and starts circling and Tucker can feel him automatically trying to tug a hand back down to stifle the sound
Tucker tightens his grip just enough to keep Wash’s wrists where they are and the look Wash gives him is wide-eyed and wanting and somehow stunned and there’s no way Tucker’s going to last at this rate
He finds a pace that has them both groaning and gasping into each other’s necks and soon Wash is writhing underneath him and saying Tucker
Tucker
I’m
But Tucker can feel it can feel the way that Wash is simultaneously trying to thrust his hips up and rub his dick against Tucker’s stomach
He lets go of one of Wash’s wrists and instead of clutching at the sheets or trying to cover his mouth again Wash keeps his hand there fingers curling tightly around one of the metal bars at the head of their bed
For some reason that’s what does it
Wash’s hand just where Tucker put it wrapped around the cold metal bed frame holding on so tight that Tucker can see the muscles in his arm straining
He comes hard himself only a few seconds after getting his hand around Wash’s dick but Wash isn’t far behind thrusting desperately up into Tucker’s palm and coming with a moan that Tucker sincerely hopes the entire base heard
Tucker keeps jerking at him until Wash collapses onto the bed boneless and thoroughly wrung out
Tucker yanks off the condom throws it in the trash and falls on top of Wash
Tucker Wash protests but there’s no real conviction in his voice
You’re making a mess
He’s not wrong
Wash’s jizz is all over both of them and the sheets are a total mess but Tucker can’t bring himself to care just yet
God that was good he sighs against Wash’s chest
You’re like super sexy dude
Hmm
Wash sighs content and runs a hand down Tucker’s back
You’re not so bad yourself
Wash reaches an arm over the side of the bed and retrieves the towel they used last night
Come on
Before it dries
Tucker grumbles but grabs the towel and sits up enough to wipe himself off
Fine fine We’re probably not going to have time to take a shower Wash says and glances at the clock
Ah dammit
We should really get going Tucker whips the towel away and tackles Wash back down to the mattress with a grin
Yeah in that voice
All disappointed and shit
Well
I mean
You wanna stay in bed with me all day Tucker crows
You wanna bang me like ten more times and cuddle and take naps and
He ducks as Wash whips a pillow at his head
I’m not the one preventing us from getting up and eat pizza and drink wine and shit damn do you think we can even get pizza on this planet
Probably not
Well whatever
We can eat MREs in bed I’ll fix ‘em up so they don’t taste like shit
Wash plants a kiss on his forehead with a sigh rolling off the bed
If only
Tucker’s grin fades as Wash sits up and starts hunting for his Kevlar suit
He drinks in the sight of Wash moving naked around his room a weird burst of panic surging through him when Wash steps into the suit and it knits itself up his back
Wait he blurts and Wash pauses in the act of strapping on his chest plate
What’s wrong
I just Tucker toys with the edge of the sheet suddenly unable to look at Wash
It hits him then the unfairness of this that they can’t stay in bed and eat pizza and fuck the day away that in all odds they won’t be able to for some time
This war this real war that they’re all wrapped up in is far from over and they’ve both already almost died a whole bunch of times and probably will a bunch more
Wash is in front of him then tipping his chin up wordlessly and Tucker rallies
We’re gonna fuck again right he asks trying to make it sound like a throwaway question
I mean you’re not gonna leave and get all weird or think I’m like regretting this or something
Because I’m not just so you know
I mean I think you’re hot like super fucking sexy and if you want I mean I’d like to fuck you again ‘cause you may not have a sexy wish list but I sure do
Wash’s lips are cool and gentle and somehow already familiar
Tucker presses into them curls a hand in Wash’s hair and just soaks in it the feel of his lips and hair and the faint scruff on his chin
I’d like that Wash says formally when he pulls away like the gigantic dork he is
I’d like that a lot
Okay cool Tucker says the perfect picture of casualness and he vaults off the bed to start dressing next to Wash
Their armor is all mixed together on the floor and it keeps drawing Tucker’s eye the bright aqua next to the steel and yellow plates
It looks good Tucker thinks
Wash’s armor looks damn good on his floor and Wash looks damn good in his bed and that smile looks damn good on his face and if you’d told Tucker even ten weeks ago that this would be what he woke up to he would never have believed it not in a million years
That’s love and sex in a warzone for you Tucker thinks
He thinks it quietly a half-recognized thing the love just barely fluttering on the edges of the thoughts
That’s the thing
You never know when it’s coming
Before you ask the answer is yes we fucked and yes it was awesome
Tucker whips his helmet off pleased and stares around
He waits for the inevitable gasps and inquiries the misty eyes from Donut the pat on the back from Grif the
He’s so caught up in imagining this scene rife with high fives and cat calls that it takes him several seconds to realize that the only reaction is Wash’s mortified voice hissing Tucker
Tucker frowns
Uh did you guys hear what I just said
With another exasperated look Wash takes off jogging around the track
Caboose stands up pats Tucker on the head and says Nice try Tucker before taking off after him
Tucker gapes after the pair of them before whipping back to the rest of his friends
He had admittedly spent a good portion of the morning waiting for someone to come up to him and say something half the base had done little else for weeks but no one had so much had glanced in his direction
He’d been sure that the rest of the Reds and Blues would have something to say at least but so far they’re letting him down big time
Wait whoa did he think I was lying
I’m not lying we did fuck
Sure you did Tucker Grif yawns
I’m sure it was great
What fuck yeah it was
It was awesome and you wish you’d been there
Please spare us the details Sarge grunts and takes off after Caboose and Wash
Tucker stares after them before jamming his helmet back on feeling unreasonably disgruntled
Don’t you guys have a bet going on or something
Believe it or not some of us have more important things to worry about than your sex life Tucker Simmons sniffs
His tone isn’t aggressive but it’s way sharper than Tucker’s used to and he turns to Grif confused
Okay what’s going on
Geez someone get Donut here to lighten the mood Tucker glances around frowning
Where is Donut anyway
Grif and Simmons probably think the glance they exchange is a subtle one but Tucker’s known them both too long to be fooled
His heart plummets straight into the ground
Whoa what’s wrong
What happened
Donut’s recon mission ran a little long this morning Simmons say after another half-glance at Grif
His squad isn’t back yet and wewe lost radio contact
What are you kidding me
Tucker finds himself instinctively turning towards the track but Wash is a quarter mile away a steel blur in the distance
What the fuck Simmons
What are we still doing here
We should be looking for him we should
His thoughts chase themselves wildly through his head each one laced with guilt
He’d known Donut was going on a recon mission at some ungodly hour well before dawn which ridiculous whoever thought to put Donut on a mission involving stealth was a moron but he’d assumed they weren’t due back just yet
It’s probably nothing Grif says striving for casual but only succeeding marginally
I’m sure he’ll be back any minute
Then you can talk to him all you want about the fake sex you had with Wash
How late is he
Tucker demands
Like five minutes late or two hours late
Three hours Simmons says glumly
Three hours
Three did you know about this
Tucker demands as Wash finishes his lap and comes to a slow halt near them
About Donut
Wash paces in tiny circles hands on his hips as he catches his breath
What about Donut
Were they not able to get the numbers we needed
Well that’s something that we could ask them Tucker says if they were back yet
Wash stops walking glancing between him and Simmons
Wait the squad isn’t back yet
Have they radioed in
What happened
Wow it’s like you guys are soulmates or something Grif mutters sarcastically
Wash glares at him
Grif
Answer the question
Which one
Simmons hastens to answer
Smart move
That’s the problem
We lost radio contact about five hours ago just a little before they were due back
No one’s sure why there were no sounds of a struggle no hint that they were in trouble
Their signal justwent out
Uh back to my original question why are we still here
Tucker waves his arms
We should be looking for them
Well of course we should
Tucker turns to see Sarge slowing to a halt next to them
Caboose is still off jogging in slow circles around the track
It’s what I’ve been saying all morning
None of this standin’ around waiting crap
It makes for more sense if we and just where do you think you’re going
Wash doesn’t slow in his pointed stalk away from the track
You should have told me this the second we arrived he says over his shoulder and it’s pretty over the top but Tucker can’t help but agree
Grif snorts
Uh we couldn’t exactly get a word in edgewise with Tucker here going on about his sex life again
Wash wait
Simmons scampers over to Wash his voice still just barely drifting back to the rest of the group
Where are you going
To get some answers
Well it’s about goddamn time
Sarge says and immediately ambles off after them
Their voices finally trail off as they get farther away
Tucker watches the place where they disappeared his stomach tying itself in knots as Simmons throws up his hands and stalks back to the group leaving Sarge and Wash on their own
He’s fine Tucker tells himself firmly
Donut’s fine
They’re all fine
Wait
He whirls to face Grif
Who else was with him
Grif shrugs picking up a pebble and throwing it across the canyon
UhPatil Ali Bitters and Matthews
Who assigns these missions anyway
Tucker snaps
I mean Patil can at least keep his mouth shut but who in their right mind would put Donut on intel
Or Matthews
I don’t know Tucker obviously it wasn’t me It’s a short sulky work-out session
Caboose is loud and anxious Simmons is quite possibly even louder and Tucker is surprised Grif doesn’t pull a muscle with how hard he’s pretending not to give a shit about the whole thing
Tucker sneaks off by himself at one point and tries to send a message to Donut way 2 get urself lost asshole but his heart sinks when SIGNAL OUT OF RANGE flashes across his HUD
Okay this is bullshit Tucker announces striding out from behind the crumbling wall he’d been lurking behind
C’mon let’s go see what’s happening
No one tries to argue with him
The four of them make their way back into the base and after some arguing about where to go head into the conference room
Ha Tucker says triumphantly as they start down the corridor to the sounds of what is unmistakably Wash and Kimball arguing
Told you they’d be here
Suck it Red
Grif mutters something Tucker can’t quite make out
Probably for the best
The four of them huddle in the doorway of the war room hesitating on the threshold
Kimball is there in the center of the room panning through a series of holographic maps with Epsilon floating over her right shoulder Wash hovering by their left
Carolina is off to the side clearly in the middle of lecturing Doyle who Tucker is impressed to see hasn’t collapsed shaking into a chair
It takes Tucker a moment to figure out exactly what is so striking about the scene and he finds his gaze pulled constantly between Wash and Epsilon until he realizes the perfect mirror image they create
They’re both standing inches away from Kimball arms folded heads tilted in towards the map
If it weren’t for the marked size difference they could be twins in that moment just really think we should send someone else out there Wash is saying tersely
Really General I’m not questioning your decisions but
Except that’s exactly what you’re doing she snaps
Caboose Grif and Simmons shove their way into the room and as Tucker moves to follow them he finds himself yanked backwards so hard he almost falls over
He whips around furiously to see Sarge with a finger to his visor gesturing at him to keep quiet
Tucker glares at him but continues to follow him down the hallway
What the fuck are we doing he hisses once they’re safely out of earshot of the meeting room
And why did you have to nearly take rip my arm out of its socket to do it
Quite your bitchin’ Sarge says dismissive
I saw the opportune moment and I took it
Opportune moment to do what
To mount a rescue mission of course
To mount a whoa
Tucker slows his walk and when Sarge doesn’t follow suit yanks on his arm to bring him to a halt
You’re kidding right
We don’t even know where they are
Sarge jerks his arm out of Tucker’s grasp
We ain’t gonna find that out standing around wringing our handkerchiefs now are we
But with a muttered curse Tucker takes off after him
Sarge wait
We can’t mount a two-person rescue mission
Sure we can
Isn’t that what you boys when you came to fetch us
Okay that was different we knew where you guys were at least something occurs to Tucker and he frowns suspiciously at Sarge’s back
And why do you want me to come on it anyway
Are you forgetting the last time we ran a mission together
It was fucking unbearable
Sarge scoffs
That’s only because you were jealous that Agent Washington propositioned me for a threesome
I was not jealous
Don’t fucking start that again and besides it’s not like I had many options
It was either you Grif or Caboose
Caboose is a good kid but he can’t pull off the kind of stealth this mission requires and Grifwell need I start listing Grif’s shortcomings
You really don’t
He does anyway
Sarge yammers on and on about Grif’s endless faults all the way down to the landing bay and pauses only to puff up his chest at the Federalist soldier manning the Pelicans and inform him that he’s on a top secret mission
Important Colonel business you see
He moves on to pointing out Simmons’ inadequacies as they stride aboard their chosen Pelican and with a special vehemence segways into a long-winded rant about Donut and how boy’s got good intuition but good Lord there’s no field voice there at all he could be standin’ right next to you and feel the need to scream Uh huh Tucker says absently as the Pelican hums to life
Sarge seriously
Do you even know where we’re going
Of course I do
Well then do you mind cluing me the fuck in
He grabs Sarge’s wrist before he can slam the Pelican into gear and take them to who know where
Sarge
Sarge tuts impatiently and deigns Tucker with a half-glance in his direction
Way station
The one where you boys overheard Charon talking on your way to find us
Where Grif found the slurpies
That’s the one
Sarge flicks a few more switches on the dashboard and Tucker wonders ominously if he even knows what he’s doing
They’re still meeting there
The mercs
The Generals put Donut on the mission ‘cause they needed a tracking device in there and fact is Donut’s got one hell of an arm
He was supposed to lob the son-of-a-bitch right in from a good distance away
Tucker stares at him
How do you know all of this
Because Sarge says slamming the gearshift forward
I helped plan the damn mission
Tucker falls silent as the Pelican creeps forward and the soldiers who were still milling around in confusion on the runway scatter
They secured the tracking device Sarge says abruptly
Signal’s reading loud and clear
We just can’t get a read on their Pelican
Could be anywhere
Could be crashed
Could be on the other side of the planet
Could be
Returning back to Armonia as we speak
Could what
Look
Tucker jabs his finger at the windshield of their own Pelican
Uh I think that might be them
They stare at each other until Sarge slams their own Pelican back into reverse and Tucker runs around flicking off headlights and shutting hatchways
Nevermind we won’t be needing that after all
Sarge calls as the two of them book it off the Pelican and run towards the one descending
It’s cool Tucker said
It’s cool I don’t think anyone noticed we were even gone
This happy illusion is shattered as Kimball’s voice sounds across the landing bay
Just what the hell do the two of you think you’re doing
Tucker turns to see everyone they’d left behind in the war room storming towards them
Look the ship’s back he says brightly waving in the general direction of the descending Pelican
We are aware of that thank you Captain Tucker Kimball snaps
What we
Sarge get back here
We still don’t know why we lost contact with them
We don’t know who’s on that ship
Sarge doesn’t slow but he does pull his shotgun off of his back
A quick glance around confirms that everyone else is reacting similarly
They wait with baited breath as the Pelican lands the ramp opens and
Tucker almost wilts in relief when he sees Donut come ambling off the Pelican
His helmet is off and there’s no small amount of blood in his hair but it seems to be mostly dry
Ali has one of Donut’s arms slung over his shoulders and he jerks them both to a stop when he sees the number of guns pointed at them
Whoa whoa whoa it’s us
Sarge Agent Washington check the Pelican Kimball says tersely and everyone freezes for several minutes while they hasten to do so
It’s clear Wash says a few minutes later ducking back off of the ship
Ali continues helping Donut back down the Pelican ramp and Tucker moves forward to pull Donut’s other arm over his shoulders
Oh don’t be silly Tucker I’m fine
Donut says brightly
Just a little bump on the head
Yeah yeah Tucker says making his voice as nonchalant as he possibly can
Let’s go get you a band aid
Where’s your helmet
Matthews has it Donut says
He’s a good kid
Right Tucker glances over Donut’s head to frown at Ali
Out of the corner of his eye he sees Patil gesturing to Kimball and Doyle
What happened
Well Ali says with a sigh we got the tracking device on no problem
The fuckers didn’t even realize we were there
We got back to the Pelican and they were waiting for us
The bird took some heavy fire shorted out our GPS tracking but we pulled through
He pauses then adds grudgingly That Bitters guy
He can fly alright
They make it to the infirmary and get Donut situated with Doctor Grey
Tucker sits on the bench outside and Ali sits with him long after Kimball arrives to debrief him long after Matthews arrives to hand over Donut’s helmet
The silence between them is comfortable and when Ali finally speaks his words crack through it like a whip
Who’s Doc
Tucker glances up sharply turning to see Ali’s dark eyes boring into his
What
Doc
Ali rubs absently at some of the blood on his shoulder guard
Donut’s blood
He talks about him a lot
They a thing
Iyeah
Tucker stares at the infirmary doors guilt twisting his stomach into knots
They were a thing
Were
Tucker shifts uncomfortably
Wearen’t really sure what happened to him
When we all got split up we thought he was with Donut's group they thought he was with ours
Simmons thinks something went wrong with the future cubes so He could be anywhere
Yeah
Tucker glances at Ali
Is uh
Is he upset about it
Ali shrugs leaning his head back against the wall
Eh
Hard to tell with Donut ya know
ButI don’t think so
Seems to think they’ll find each other again
He looks at Tucker
Far as I can tell anyway
I don’t know him as well as you
Sounds to me like you know him pretty well dude
He’s a good guy
Ali nudges Tucker’s shoulder a little
You all are
I guess
Yeah yeah whatever But he looks at Ali really looks at him at the eyes so dark they’re nearly black the scar that starts at his temple and stretches all the way to his collar the only mark on his smooth umber skin
Thanks for uhhaving his back
Andlistening to him
Tucker clears his throat
I should’ve been doing that
Another shrug
He just likes to talk
Tell stories
I like to listen
He kicks his boot over at Tucker’s
Let’s hear some of yours
Tucker laughs a little then side-eyes him
Well
You wanna hear about the fucking awesome sex I had this morning
Ali perks up in interest
Hell yeah I do shit man I’m not getting any They sit there watching the infirmary doors and swapping stories
Ali is a good listener Tucker realizes and an even better storyteller himself
Tucker tells Ali about the desert and Ali tells him about how he was a budding artist before the bombs dropped and he passes over his datapad and Tucker flips through his drawings in awe
Dude you should not be in the fucking army this is some Picasso level shit and finally finally Dr Grey gives them permission to see Donut
Tucker examines the stitches on his head and tries not to hover and Donut chatters away brightly and Tucker wonders just how many more close calls they can take before their luck runs out
It’s only early evening when Tucker meets Wash in their usual training room to do some more knife training but Tucker feels as if he hasn’t slept in three days
He feels sick to his stomach every time he thinks of Donut with that bright smile on his face waving them all off
I’m fine guys really
Just a little bump on the head
This time
God
Talk about melodramatic
He really has been spending too much time with Wash lately
Tucker shoves his worries down deep and brightens when he pushes the door open to see Wash already in his fatigues
If that isn’t a sight for sore eyes Tucker doesn’t what is
Wash gives him a look when Tucker expresses this sentiment
It’s more exasperated than turned on so Tucker takes his helmet off nice and slow and while that does get Wash’s eyes to track the motion of his hair in a mesmerized sort of way it doesn’t exactly get Wash to jump his bones
Tucker sighs but gets to work unsnapping his armor
Why are we training in our civvies
We haven’t done that in ages
Exactly
I thought it was something worth cycling back to
Besides I was thinking we could do something a little different
Tucker pauses in the act of lifting off his chest plate to wink at Wash
Oh-ho
Well in that case Wash holds out a set of training clothes for Tucker still packing his goddamn clothes apparently as he moves to unzip his Kevlar suit
It seems a little silly to put on clothes that Tucker’s hoping he’s just going to be ripping right back off but he puts them on anyway and sits down as close as he can possibly get to Wash
Wash doesn’t pull away or flinch when their legs touch but he does snag Tucker’s hand when he trails it up the inside of Wash’s thigh
Tucker
Come on
Tucker flushes a sharp and unexpected hurt lancing through him and he propels himself to his feet
Ugh see I knew you were gonna get all weird
Wash stares at him looking almost bewildered enough for it to be convincing at Tucker’s outburst
What
I knew you were gonna get all weird and distant after we fucked
What
I’m not getting distant
Tucker we are training
I know you had a bad day but
Look if you don’t want this to be a thing you can just say so you don’t have to
He promptly shuts the fuck up because Wash reaches up fists a hand in his t-shirt and yanks Tucker back down to him so fiercely that he half falls in Wash’s lap
Wash’s mouth his hot and insistent and it’s all Tucker can do to grip tightly onto his shoulders and try not to fall over on the spot
He holds on and lets Wash kiss the fucking life out of him and he’s gasping and wide-eyed when Wash pulls back
Wash presses three soft kisses to his cheek and pulls away enough to look Tucker in the eye
Let’s get a few things straight he says and holy shit Tucker will listen to anything Wash says if he does it in that fucking voice
I do want you
I’m not going anywhere
But right now we are training
I am trying to teach you something that can save your life and I need you to pay attention
Are we clear
Yes Tucker breathes
Yes sir
Wash kisses him again softer this time before standing
And you say I’m dramatic
Tucker huffs
Okay look it’s been a weird fucking day that whole thing with Donut was fucked and I hate training these knives without armor
I hate it
Which is exactly why we have to do it Wash says
I was thinking we could try something new
Work with metal knives today
Tucker straightens in alarm
Wait what
Do the evasion drill with real knives
Are you fucking crazy
I didn’t say real knives I said metal knives
With blunted edges
Wash gives him a look
I wouldn’t do this drill with sharp knives Tucker
Shit I don’t know dude you like to spar without fucking mouth guards and shit so
Tucker frowns
How would that help
It’s the same shit we’ve been doing just with metal instead of rubber
You’ve been doing remarkably well with the rubber knives Wash says moving to rummage in his bag
But the rubber knives are clearly fake
I think it would help to see how you react to something that looks real
So they’re back on that again
Okay but I know they’re not real
It’s not going to make a difference
You’re willing to try it then
Tucker’s eyes track his movements as Wash pulls the knives out
Uh are you sure those aren’t real
Of course I’m sure Tucker
He holds them out to Tucker who sincerely hopes Wash didn’t see the way he just flinched
Check them yourself
That’s okay Tucker says quickly
I trust you
I appreciate that Wash says but I’d prefer that you check them anyway
Their eyes lock and Tucker suddenly thinks that he might not be the only person these lessons are difficult for
He takes the knives from Wash and runs his fingers tentatively over the edges
They are blunt the edges and tips rounded and smooth
They’re not that much different from the rubber knives really but the way the metal flashes and catches the light is rather unnerving
Fine he blurts before he can think too hard on it
Fine whatever
Let’s do it
He ignores the calculating look Wash gives him and lunges into the bag grabbing that stupid red chalk that Wash seems to have an endless supply of and coating the knives himself
Once the knives are good and covered he stands and takes a place in the center of the training room
You ready
Wash asks
He twirls one of the knives in his hand in an absent-minded sort of way
Tucker tries not to focus on the way it gleams in the light
Yep Tucker says and gestures impatiently
Wash wastes no time as usual and Tucker barely jumps out of the way of the first slash
The gesture is wild and exaggerated and Tucker’s overcorrection almost gets him a slash across the throat in the first five seconds
He tries to let his eyes go a little unfocused the way Wash had taught him but his vision keeps zeroing in on the bright knife as he tracks it
It costs him
Wash catches the edge of the knife against his arm and draws a chalk mark from Tucker’s shoulder to the crook of his elbow
The metal is cold and flat but it doesn’t hurt
Obviously
It’s not real
There’s no reason for him to be freaked out there’s no pain none at all except there hadn’t been any pain when Felix had stuck that knife in his gut either
It had been so sharp and neat that Tucker hadn’t even realized what had happened until Epsilon screamed inside his head
The pain had hit him all at the same time once he’d glanced down and seen all of that red glistening and wet against his Kevlar suit red and black and blue until everything was blue and he realized that he was flat on his back staring up at the sky
Blue blue blue
Wash’s eyes are boring into his mouth moving with no words coming out
Tucker blinks hard confused at why Wash is so close and why he looks so concerned and why everything feels muted like there’s a fog inside Tucker’s head
His hand reaches out of its own accord and the solid feel of Wash’s chest beneath his hand has the sound rushing back need to breathe Wash is saying and Tucker realizes with horror that he’s backed himself right up against the wall and is shaking actually fucking shaking
Jesus Christ he bursts and curls the hand on Wash’s chest into his shirt
The other he rakes through his dreads torn between anger and humiliation
Don’t look at me like that I’m fine I’m fine
Wash folds his own hand around Tucker’s and Tucker realizes the hand he’s clenched in Wash’s shirt is trembling too
Good God give it another minute or two and he’ll be swooning
He gives it up and takes a few short deep breathes trying to get his goddamn nerves under control
It’s alright Wash tells him quietly which somehow makes everything better and worse all at once
It’s normal to be
If you tell me it’s normal to be afraid
Tucker
Thought I was past this Tucker says abruptly
He can’t quite meet Wash’s eye when he says it
Thought I was fuck this is so stupid
It’s not
Wash slides his hand to Tucker’s wrist and tugs him away from the wall
You’re okay
Come on
The training session does not improve
If anything it gets worse
Within thirty minutes Tucker is covered in chalk and nearly pulling out his hair in frustration
Fuck fuck fuck
Why can’t I fucking get this
Alright alright
Wash pulls Tucker’s hands away from his hair
Let’s try something else
Tucker follows him reluctantly
He watches with his arms folded tightly across his chest as Wash reaches into his gym bag and pulls out yet another case of knives
Waaaait a second
Those are real aren’t they
They are Wash says calmly selecting one and hefting it in his hand
Okay unless you want this chalk to be actual blood then Wash glances up sharply at that
What
No
We’re not just wait
He puts the knife back and Tucker watches as he sets his datapad on the floor
After a few taps something big and bright projects itself onto the wall across the room one large target and several smaller ones
Tucker looks from the target to Wash confused until Wash picks up another knife
He stands flips the knife so that he’s holding it by the blade and flings it across the room
It hits the wall with a thunk and rests quivering in the center of the target
Dude Tucker says
It’s all he can manage
Dude
Do that again
Wash’s mouth twitches in the beginnings of a smile
He grabs another knife steps backwards several feet and hits another perfect bulls eye right next to the first knife
Show off Tucker says with a grin
What the fuck
That’s so badass can I do that
That’s the plan
Wash gestures and Tucker goes to him
Now
Knife throwing is all about depth perception that’s how you decide if you should throw it by the handle or the blade
He gathers up several knives and walks until they’re only three feet from the target
Here you’re close enough to hold the knife by the handle
It’s all a matter of body positioning and hand eye coordination
You need to keep your arm straight and He throws the knife so hard that the blade sinks halfway up the hilt
That’s some aim you got there babe Tucker can’t resist quipping because come on
Wash gives him a look but doesn’t say anything just moves back further
At this range I’m approximately six feet away
I want to throw the knife from the blade at this distance
Six feet farther back it’s the handle
Six feet farther it’s the blade
And so on and so forth
Jesus
How do you know how far back you are
Depth perception Wash says again
It’s not as hard as it sounds
It’s just practice
Finding points of comparison in your environment
I don’t know man it seems kind of like magic to me
It’s not
Wash flips another knife in his hand and holds it out to him handle first
Come on
You try
Tucker hesitates
He supposes the whole thing is kind of badass and he thinks that if there’s a chance that he looks even half as sexy as Wash does hurling knives around then this just might be a skill worth learning
Fine fine fine
Let’s fucking do it
His first knife smacks sideways into the wall and clatters unceremoniously to the floor
His second one doesn’t even make it to the wall
The third one he drops at his feet
He doesn’t like the sound the knives make as they fall but the weight of the throwing blades feels nice in his hand and Wash’s body is strong and reassuring when he stands behind Tucker and adjusts his arm and shoulders and hips
When Tucker sticks his first knife he whoops and runs around the training room in a victory lap
It’s not a bulls-eye but it’s on the goddamn target
That’s Felix’s fucking shoulder right there he crows snagging his own datapad to snap a picture
Oh man wait I gotta show this to Grif Tucker sends the picture over to Grif and whirls back to face Wash who is watching him fondly
Before Wash can lose the expression Tucker aims the datapad at him to snap a picture
Wash blinks startled and makes a swipe for the datapad
Did you justgive me that
Tucker holds it out of his reach
Dude no way
That should like be your profile picture on Basebook
I don’t have Basebook
Yeah I know but you should Wash rolls his eyes but when Tucker flips the datapad around to take a pictures of them he doesn’t resist
Man we are so fucking hot Tucker says in approval examining the photo
We could make serious bank pumping out some amateur porn
We are not pumping out amateur porn Tucker Tucker doesn’t stick every knife after that but he sticks at least half of them
Wash is practically beaming at the end and Tucker soaks it in the smile the knives in the wall
It’s a start alright
It’s a goddamn good start
The soldiers move below him like tiny ants
Wash adjusts the scope on his sniper rifle and shifts his weight infinitesimally
There’s a rock wedged up under his right thigh and it wouldn’t be a big deal for him to move it
Charon’s soldiers are far enough away that they won’t hear him but he’s trying to set a good example
The soldiers under his command have done nothing but fidget and bicker since their arrival at this outpost three hours ago
Fidgeting he can handle
Complaining he’s used to but the bickering
Would you hold still already
I am holding still
You are not
I can’t see shit with you knocking my scope all over the place hold it still
Bet you’d be able to see a little better if I kicked your ass right over the side of this cliff how ‘bout that
Wash reflects dully that he should be used to the bickering by now as well seeing as it makes up three quarters of the Reds and Blues’ conversations but Wash can’t help feeling like that’s different somehow
At the end of the day his guys would take bullets for each other
They’d deny it vehemently after insisting it was an accident or coincidence but he knows better
Listening to the Feds and News gripe at each other has Wash pretty well convinced that Prajapati actually would shove Sabine off the cliff if she thought she could get away with it
They’ve been out here for several hours keeping an eye on one of the way stations where they’re been a lot of activity
Wash and his squad were monitoring activity from a higher vantage point while a few of their other soldiers led by Captain Perry tried to get close enough to listen below
Be quiet he hisses and Prajapati and Sabine both falter
You’re going to give away our position
You mean the position that’s ten million miles away from where the action is
Prajapati mutters sourly
Yeah wouldn’t want to do that Wash groans to himself as Sabine starts sputtering
Oh I see that’s how you speak to your Commanding Officer
Agent Washington deserves our respect
I never said I didn’t respect him
Come on Agent Washington is cool
Wash grins to himself at the thought of the looks on the sim troopers’ faces if they ever heard anyone describe him as cool
It was a shame that none of them were here not only so that they could hear that but because they had a way of getting these soldiers to ease up in a way that he did not sure as shit don’t respect you
Oh come on Falguni
Britton pipes up over the radio
Sabine’s not so bad
You should hear some of her theories of Grey’s Anatomy they’re pure genius
Wash rolls his eyes
Britton status report
How are things over there
The same as they were ten minutes ago
Banks one of the Feds he’d paired up with Britton sighs
They’re not talking about anything important at all
Oh now who’s speaking disrespectfully to their commanding officer
Prajapati mutters sourly
What
I wasn’t speaking disrespectfully to Agent Washington
I was merely stating the facts
Agent Washington the sky is blue
Like that
Was that disrespectful
Enough Perry says
Wash is somewhat mollified to hear that Perry sounds just as thoroughly done with this mission as Wash is
Christ will you all just knock it off already
The newbie bitch started it
The newbie bitch is gonna finish it too
Britton snickers
Ooooh good one Falguni
Wash sighs
Private Britton
Sorry Agent Washingtonoh
Perry
I think
Captain Perry
Right that
I think I see a way to get closer over on my side
Might be able to sneak in and get a recording all ninja like
Wash readjusts the scope on his visor until he locates Britton’s white and gold armor
She’s shimmying forward on her belly under a rocky outcrop just outside of where the pirates are convening
That’s awfully close Britton
Are you even sure you can fit under there
I can do it I swear
I’ll be real quiet
Wash hesitates
Well alright move up
I’ll cover you
Prajapati shoulders Sabine out of the way of their shared scope
BB be careful that tunnel is sooo tiny and you’re really close to the guards
Banks hold position Perry orders
I’ll move up to cover her
The three of them watch as Perry slides around the northwestern wall his back pressed tight to the rocks
The pirates are clustered together in the center of the way station and from what Wash can tell arguing vehemently
Britton wriggles carefully underneath the rocks
I’m in she breathes
Got my external mic going
Oh man this is good they’re talking about supplies maybe we can actually get some tampons on the next run Wash watches anxiously but she seems well-concealed and the pirates aren’t paying attention until all at once they start to disperse
Several of them move out towards their grouping of Warthogs
We have movement Wash says
They’re moving towards their Warthogs
Britton stay down until they pass
Captain Perry you guys gotta go Britton breathes
They’re gonna drive right past you and Banks and you’ve got nowhere to hide
Great Perry mutters
Alright I’ll swing around the southwestern entrance and meet up with you
No
I can’t get out of here until they’re all gone
You gotta go I’ll catch up
No you will not Prajapati says loudly
Don’t be stupid
I’m not being stupid Volleyball I’m being a hero so
Perry get your squad out of there now Wash says sharply
Britton you’re clear they’ve moved passed your position you’re clear
On it Perry says crisply
Not bad Britton
Did you get the recording
Who gives a fuck about the recording
Prajapati’s voice comes high over the radio
BB get out of there now
I’m going
Britton hisses and they watch as she wriggles out from the outcropping and pushes to a slow stand creeping backwards
Just give me
In her retreat through the narrow tunnel Britton’s shoulder catches hard against the wall
Wash inhales sharply as the guards whirl around to face her direction one of them reaching for something at his belt
Britton go
Uh-oh Britton whispers over the radio and suddenly the world is filled with noise
The explosion is so loud that it very nearly leaves Wash’s ears ringing from all the way up on the cliff
It’s still not loud enough to drown out Prajapati’s howl her NO so loud that Wash is convinced Charon’s soldiers must’ve heard it
Before he can utter a word to silence her she lunges forward and leaps off the cliff
PRAJAPATI dammit
Wash pushes himself to his feet snapping the rifle to his back
Sabine come on
Come on and do what go jumping over the cliff like a
Her words trail off into a scream as Wash grabs her arm and vaults off the overhang after Prajapati
The drop is steep but not sheer and he keeps a firm grip on Sabine as they skid down the hill
Prajapati is about twenty-five feet ahead of them and sprinting fast towards the way station
Wash can make out several indistinct forms moving frantically through the smoke but little else
Cover her he shouts to Sabine as Prajapati barrels into the fray and stabs a knife clean into the throat of the nearest pirate
He brings his own rifle up to bear mowing down the other two approaching her from the left
The KA-POW of Sabine’s shotgun explodes next to him and another pirate falls
Through the smoke Wash can see Banks grappling with two more
He casts his gaze around desperately but Perry and Britton are nowhere to be seen
The fighting doesn’t last long
The pirates clearly weren’t expecting another group and in less than five minutes they’re all standing around staring at each other as the smoke dissipates
Clear the area Wash says tersely and they fan out guns up
He fiddles with his radio frequency
Captain Perry
Private Britton
Do you copy
Perry’s voice comes tight and exhausted over the radio
I’ve got her
She’s alive but she’s Perry’s hesitation is brief but it’s enough to tie Wash’s stomach into knots
Wash
She lost her arm
Prajapati takes off like a shot without a word and Wash spins to the other two
Banks get a Warthog ready
Sabine with me
Perry we’re coming to you
Is she stable
Working on it Perry says tensely
They all turn the corner to see Perry bending over Britton’s weakly stirring form
Her arm has been blown off just above the elbow the dirt around her body stained dark and wet
Wash’s HUD lights up with warning signs as his medical suite locks onto Britton
CONDITION CRITICAL BLOOD LOSS MINOR HEAD TRAUMA
He barely has time to drop to his knees and get a firm hold on Britton’s shoulders as Perry gives his biofoam canister a few shakes and injects the can into Britton’s the bleeding stump where Britton’s arm once was
Britton jolts back to a full consciousness with a howl as the biofoam seals off the blood vessels and capillaries in her arm
She thrashes beneath Wash’s hands and he hates himself more than a little at the sob that rips through her scream
Stop
Stooooop
It hurts it hurts
I know
You’re okay Private you’re okay
Wash half-turns
Prajapati I need you to unsnap the healing unit from my chestplate and give it to Britton
She’s on it before he’s finished speaking hands steady as she unsnaps his healing unit and affixes it to Britton’s armor
Britton relaxes beneath his hands almost immediately her screams petering off into sobs
M-my arm she gasps
I-I-I
Falguni my arm
Prajapati tugs the helmet off of her head to reveal Britton’s tearstained face
Britton Wash says quietly
You’re okay
We’re going to get you back to the capital
She nods her eyes already beginning fog over as the painkillers pump through her system
C-c-can we take my arm too
We can take your arm Wash says then glances at Perry
Banks should be here any moment with a Warthog
Captain Perry carry her
I’ll cover us and
No
Prajapati lunges forward as Perry lifts Britton into his arms
Her hands fasten protectively over Britton’s good shoulder
No
You give her to me I’ve got her she’s my teammate
We’re all teammates now Perry says quietly
Prajapati laughs a wild vicious sound
No we’re not
We’re not
I’ll carry her
This is going to go much faster if I
There’s a sharp intake of breath from Sabine as Prajapati takes out her gun and levels it at Perry’s head
If you don’t hand her over in the next five seconds I’ll blow your Fed brains out all over your teammates
Give
Her
To
Me
Do it Perry Wash undertones and after a half glance in his direction Perry nods
Alright
I’ll put her on your shoulders
Fireman’s carry
Watch her arm
I know Prajapati snaps
I know how to do a fireman’s carry jackass
Maybe you should take some fucking notes
As it turns out she does
Wash is more than a little impressed at the easy way she adjusts Britton’s weight on her shoulders and stalks off gun still held securely in one hand
Warthogs are all fucked up Banks announces almost running into Prajapati as she turns the corner
He has his hand pressed tight to a profusely bleeding arm but seems otherwise uninjured
Damaged in the explosion
What a bunch of rubbish aren’t these guys supposed to have top-notch equipment
They did until we took it all Sabine says
Her gaze tracks Britton
How are we going to get out of here
We’re going to walk of course Prajapati calls over her shoulder and after a shrug they all follow her
It’s at least a mile to their own Warthogs but she doesn’t falter once and when she sets Britton down in the back the movement is gentle and controlled
Wash sends a message back to Armonia all accounted for we have injured and climbs into the same Warthog as Britton
Prajapati is sitting with her in the back Britton’s head cradled in her lap
She’s barely conscious face pale and eyelids fluttering
Think she’s in shock Prajapati says stiffly maneuvering Britton’s helmet back onto her head
We gotta gotta keep her helmet on
Keep the temperature modulators working
They don’t work unless all of the armor is on
Yes that’s true
Wash trails off glancing at her in surprise as Sabine climbs into the driver’s seat
How do you know that
Bugs taught me Prajapati murmurs clutching Britton’s arm to her chest
Taught me some some medical stuff
Who Wash trails off
Not important
Never mind
Let’s keep her talking
He turns around to Sabine who has a death grip on the wheel staring straight ahead
Get us there fast he says in an undertone and she nods stiffly
He’s not so great at the talking and never has been in situations like this but as with everything else that’s been thrown in her face today Prajapati handles the situation without hesitation the time Bitters got his laces caught on the conveyor belt yeah and we damn straight BB damn straight
‘cept not oh stop she’s not a secret love you know
The conversation is thready and weak on Britton’s end but Prajapati manages to keep her engaged on the tense ride back
What he’s hearing is light and airy nonsense but underneath it all he hears the bracing the goodbyes the remember when we did this in case we never do it again
Wash is no stranger to such conversations
When Sabine finally drives the Warthog into their bay Wash can see Dr Grey and Kimball waiting in the entrance along with several other soldiers
Wash swings himself out of the Warthog before Sabine even brings it to a complete stop turning around to grab Britton
Prajapati is already moving to swing her onto her shoulders again and Wash moves to stop her
P
Falguni
Let me
I need you to give Britton’s arm to Kimball and then go get Captain Simmons and tell him what happened
She considers him for a long moment and Wash marvels at how a girl probably half his age looks harder than South ever did
He takes it as a compliment when she finally nods and takes off and he scoops up Britton’s body
She’s limp and still in his arms and so very very small
He ignores the sick feeling in his stomach at the sight of her severed arm clutched in Kimball’s arms who has appeared on his other side and carries her towards Dr Grey
What happened
Kimball asks tensely as they begin to walk
Grenade Wash says
We she was gathering intel and she got too close couldn’t get out in time
The sickening feeling grows guilt twisting in his stomach
We
I should’ve
Not the first amputation we’ve seen Agent Washington Kimball says shouldering open the door to the infirmary
Not the first by a long shot
Place her on the bed Wash Dr Grey says
Give the arm to Pickles
Pickles put that arm on ice
Pickles Wash thinks blankly
Ridiculous name
He gives himself a little shake as Pickles presumably takes the arm from Kimball
Emily is
I’ll know once I’ve had a change to get in there Dr Grey says then glances between him and Kimball
I know you both know what I’m about to say
I’m not leaving Kimball says firmly and turns to settle herself against the wall in the corner
Wash gets the feeling that she’s stood in this spot many many many times before
The feeling intensifies when Dr Grey gives a resigned sigh and turns to him
Washington hallway
Now
With a final look at Britton Wash nods backing out the door
He takes a seat on one of the benches lining the infirmary hallway
It’s deserted and after a moment he removes his helmet and leans forward to bury his head in his hands sucking in a breath
A dull buzzing disbelief flickers around inside his skull
He’s lost soldiers before men and women he was responsible for but this this
Fifteen sir
He stands abruptly pacing up and down the hallway
Fifteen fifteen fifteen
High school
Fifteen meant high school and extracurricular activities and first crushes not bombs and blood and amputated limbs
She was young they were all too young
He shouldn’t have let her go off on her own no matter how ready he thought she was
He should’ve been the one down there skulking around in the thick of things not far away on a hilltop where he couldn’t help until it was too late
He should’ve told her to get out sooner
He should’ve
He’s so lost in his thoughts that he almost misses Prajapati and Simmons striding down the hallway towards him
Simmons has his helmet clenched tightly under one arm his face pale and sickly
Volleyball says Britton lost her arm he says blankly
Is that true
Wash nods gesturing pointlessly towards the infirmary doors
Dr Grey’s operating on her now
She’s seeing if she can reattach
Prajapati barrels through the doorway dragging Simmons with her
No loved ones allowed in the operating room
Dr Grey screeches as the door flies open
The door swings shut behind them and though Wash can’t make out any of their words no one comes back out again
He has a sudden and vivid image of Kimball Simmons and Prajapati all standing in that tiny corner and has to choke back a wildly inappropriate urge to laugh
What happened
What happened
Wash glances up as Tucker comes skidding around the corner so quickly that he almost bounces off the opposing wall
He’s only got about half of his armor on and there’s a look of terror on his face that has Wash moving to meet him
Tucker everyone is what are you doing
Tucker skids up to him and starts padding around his midsection examining his hands as they pull away
He fumbles his hands around Wash’s neck slides a hand through his hair examines it and then to Wash’s surprise gives him a shove
What the fuck Wash
Wash blinks running a hand through his own hair in confusion
Uhwhat
Tucker drops onto the bench glaring up at him
You scared the shit out of me
All I heard was ‘the mission’s gone bad’ and no one seemed to know any details and then you weren’t answering your radio or your texts and I thought
Jesus Christ Wash
I’m fine Wash says quickly
I’m sorry I didn’t have my helmet on Yeah I can see that Tucker eyes him
You sure you’re not like hemorrhaging into your chest cavity and trying to put on a brave face
I wouldn’t do that Tucker
Tucker looks at him so incredulously that Wash folds his arms over his chest defensively
I wouldn’t
Uh yes you fucking would are you serious
Jesus
Tucker clenches his hands in his lap
Okay so if you’re fine I take it that means someone else kicked it
The forced callousness in his voice makes something in Wash’s chest ache
Wash sits down next to him and after a moment of hesitation folds a hand over Tucker’s
No one died but uhBrittonshe Tucker glances up sharply and Wash finds himself unable to meet his piercing gaze
She lost her arm he mutters to his lap instead
Grenade blew it clean off
He watches as Tucker’s hand clenches tightly around his
Ah fuck
Yeah Wash says squeezing back
Fuck
Tucker doesn’t tell him that it’s okay for which Wash is grateful
Is everyone else okay he asks after a while
Wash nods
They’re okay
For now Tucker mutters and presses his head back into the wall
Fuck me I’m just
I’m fucking terrified like all the time you know
I know Wash says pressing his head back against the wall as well
I know
Tucker sighs
I just
I feel like I can’t fucking control anything anymore
It’s like everyone’s all split up going off on these fucking missions and I can’t
I can’t like keep an eye on Grif and make sure he’s fucking paying attention and I can’t tell Caboose that a firefight isn’t the place to eat cookies and I can’t make sure you’re not like bleeding out on a Pelican somewhere and He clenches his hands tighter still around Wash’s
Everything’s out of my fucking hands you know
I know Wash says again and they sit there like that staring at the infirmary door until the hallway starts to fill with members of Simmons’ squad and other soldiers
In what has to be the world’s worst timing Prajapati pushes through the infirmary doors at the same moment that several of the Feds start down the hallway
No she says fiercely hands clenched into fists
No
You can’t be here you can’t
Sabine shoulders her way to the head of the group hands held up palms out turned
Prajapati please
No no she snarls back
Fuck you you don’t get to stand out here
This place is for family and you’ll never be welcome
Perry pushes Sabine aside and steps into Falguni’s space
Listen I’m sorry that this happened but you
Falguni cold clocks him and he crumbles and Wash and Tucker are on their feet and the screaming escalates words hurling and as Wash hauls her back against his chest fighting her struggles to get loose her thrashing and clawing like a caged animal he can only sigh
Wash is no stranger to this either
It’s a rough week after that
After two days during which Wash suspects Dr Grey sleeps even less than he does she sits down with him Kimball and Simmons and delivers the bad news
There’s no reattaching that pretty little arm of hers she says her tone falsely bright and a little too loud
The break wasn’t as clean as we’d hoped
Sheshe’ll need a prosthetic and we don’t exactly have those lying around oh Simmons don’t
Simmons shoves his chair back so hard that it falls over and stalks out of the room
Let him go Kimball snaps as Wash half-rises to follow him
She hasn’t torn her gaze away from Dr Grey
Can she be fitted for a prosthetic
Certainly Dr Grey says
But that sort of thing doesn’t happen overnight you see
We need
The meeting comes to an abrupt end after that as Doyle’s panicked voice sounds over their radios
Agent Washington
Miss Kimball
Agent Carolina is back with the troopers and it is not good not good at all
It isn’t
The landing bay is a nightmare Warthogs parked haphazardly soldiers from both armies spilling out of them yelling for a doctor
Dr Grey springs into action heading for the worst of it straight towards one of the Feds whose guts are being held in by his partner’s hands
He’s bleeding thick and heavy
Everyone Wash can see is bleeding even Carolina
Their gazes lock and she heads over to him and Kimball
Felix she spits
Felix and Locus
Turns out they weren’t holed up in one of their safe houses like our intel said
Her gaze shifts to Kimball
They know
They know about the transmitter Donut stuck and they’ve been feeding us false information for weeks
An anguished scream from across the landing bay cuts off her words and they whirl to see Dr Grey pulling away from the soldier whose guts had been spilling out all over
Wash watches as the dead soldier’s partner lunges on top of him his hands frantically pushing at his bulging intestines
Fuck fuck
Rickson no he grasbs frantically at Dr Grey’s arm
Doctor no you have to put them back you have to put them back
Dr Grey pulls her arm out of his grasp leaving a bloody streak across her armor
There’s no putting him back together soldier she says
There’s nothing
The soldier isn’t listening
He casts his eyes around the bay landing until they land on Kimball
You he says his voice thick with a grief and disbelief that Wash knows all too well
This is your fault
He pulls out his gun levels it at Kimball and pulls the trigger to the sound of someone screaming
The bullet misses Kimball but barely
Wash finds himself standing next to her several days later in the infirmary watching the cadets from across the room
Britton is sitting up in bed chatting animatedly with Kennedy
He’d ended up in the infirmary two days after Britton courtesy of a nasty blow to the head that left him with a severe concussion
Half a dozen of their friends are clustered around their beds
They’re watching something on Katie Jensen’s datapad sitting closer together than they normally would smiles strained
Kimball’s helmet is clutched tightly between her hands off for the first time Wash can remember
She’s young her face unmarked by scars but lined with more wrinkles around her eyes than Wash suspects she should have
They’re just kids he says to Kimball after a while because he can’t not say it even though he knows she knows it
Just kids she echoes eyes darkening
Why he asks abruptly
Whythey shouldn’t be You’re right
They shouldn’t be she says sharply hands tightening around the edges of her helmet
They should be in school drinking wine and playing volleyball and believe me I am fully aware of where they should and shouldn’t be Agent Washington
I am aware that they should be safe
She laughs again though the sound is bitter now
But there are no more safe places
Not here
Not anymore
Do you know that most of these kids are orphans
He didn’t think it was possible for his stomach to sink any lower
I didn’t
Well they are
So where would they be if not here
Dead
Starving
Doing unspeakable things for food or water
She clutches the helmet unconsciously to her chest
I picked a lot of them up from the streets out of gangs and crews who took on Feds in street clothes and booze bombs
At least here I can watch them
I can put a roof over their heads and food in their bellies and a gun in their hands
So they can protect themselves better
So that they can protect each other
Protect their home
Wash watches her for a while watching her jaw clench hard as she watches the cadets
She can speak five different languages Kimball says abruptly
Britton
She’s something of a genius
Kennedy he likes to skateboard
Martinez plays the guitar
Prajapati’s been telling me she’s seventeen for three years
I think it might finally be true
They hardly any of them should be here but they are
Here
What about you
She tears her gaze away from the cadets to stare at him
What
Wash gestures
What’s your thing
Kimball looks at him for a while before answering
I don’t have a thing Agent Washington
I don’t
I don’t even remember if I ever had a thing
I’d been following orders for as long as I can remember ‘til one day I was the only one left who could give them
I don’t have a clue what I would do if this was all over tomorrow
Wash realizes all at once that either does he
He tries to imagine a life after this one without armor and guns and knives and comes up utterly blank
Me neither he says
Me neither
Dude I don’t know about you but I am pretty fucking done with this week
Wash glances up from where he’d been staring blankly into his bowl of soup in the mess hall to see Tucker flopping throwing himself in the seat across from him shaking out his hair
He knows he’s been had when Tucker’s gaze turns suspicious
You look fucking exhausted
Have you been sleeping
Of course I haven’t been sleeping Wash says tensely and everyone’s exhausted
We lost five soldiers this week one got her arm blown off another’s in a coma and our big play with the transmitter was a failure so you’ll forgive me if I haven’t exactly been sleeping beauty
Tucker sighs loudly
Wash
Look just just let it go alright
I’m fine
He can feel Tucker’s eyes on him even as he determinedly avoids his gaze
I know you’re still beating yourself up about that mission but running yourself ragged isn’t gonna help anyone
If you need a break you gotta say something
That’s all
I don’t need a break Wash says
What I need is a way to to give these soldiersI don’t know hope or some kind of distraction at least
Tucker slams his fist on the table with such enthusiasm that Wash jolts half out of his seat
What
What
What’s today’s date
Tucker asks whipping out his datapad and swiping through it impatiently
The fifteenth right
Yes but Wash trails off as Tucker positively beams
Tucker what’s going on
I have a brilliant idea Tucker breathes and leaps to his feet food untouched
Dude
Come on
Wash climbs slowly to a slow stand following Tucker around the table
Tucker what he speeds up his steps to keep pace with Tucker who is all but sprinting through the halls
Where are we going
A distraction Tucker murmurs half to himself
That’s it
They servers have been shitty lately so they don’t even have that dumb show to watchwe can’t make this shitty war go away but we can give them a goddamn show alright he stops so abruptly that Wash smacks into the back of him
Okay how good is your acting
Wash squints at him suspiciously
Myacting
Tucker tuts impatient
Yes Wash
Know the word
Of course I know the word Tucker
What I don’t know is where you’re going with this
Don’t ever scare me like that again
Tucker says suddenly and he actually gives Wash a little shove
Wash stares at him bewildered
Tucker makes a rolling motion with his hand that Wash assumes is supposed to clear everything up
It doesn’t
Um he clears his throat glancing around
There is nothing in his surroundings to help him clue in as to what Tucker is talking about
They’re in a deserted hallway standing Wash notices for the first time right outside the double doors that lead to the infirmary
S sorry
Tucker rolls his eyes in despair
Play along he mouths to Wash and after several glances between Tucker and the infirmary doors it clicks
You cannot be serious he hisses mortified
Tucker’s face splits into a grin
So serious
He glances at the doors as well
Look it’s the fifteenth yeah
We do this today and Britton wins the betting pool
You in or what
Goddammit
Wash closes his eyes briefly in embarrassment before taking a breath squaring his shoulders and flinging open the infirmary doors with a flourish
You’re being ridiculous Captain Tucker
I’m fine
This time
He hears Tucker crashing through after him
I don’t know how much more of this I can take Washington
Wash lets his pacing carry him through the rows of beds in the infirmary right past the section where Britton and Kennedy are recovering several of their friends clustered around their beds
They all falter as Tucker and Wash come to a halt across the room
I don’t know what you’re talking about
Of course not
Tucker says dramatically
Wash admits a grudging respect for his acting abilities
Because you don’t listen you don’t see do you
His hands come up to grasp Wash’s desperately as he moves closer
Your move he mouths the snarky little shit
Clearly he doesn’t think Wash can rise to the occasion
I do see Wash says voice low enough that out of the corner of his eye he sees the cadets lean closer to catch his words
Idon’t you understand Tucker
You’re all I see
But we can’tI can’t He breaks off as if it’s too much for him pulling away from Tucker and facing the opposite direction
I can’t lose you he whispers dramatically and lets the silence sit
Tucker grabs his arm to spin him back around and Wash lets him
I can’t lose you either you idiot he says and then he’s ripping off Wash’s helmet tugging him close and dipping him backwards
The kiss is ridiculous and over the top but it’s also nice and soft and hungry in a way that makes him think Tucker isn’t entirely joking
He cups his hands around the back of Tucker’s head and feels Tucker’s mouth turn up in a grin as the cadets almost fall over each other with gasps and hushes
I need you Wash Tucker whispers and Wash has to bite back a snicker it’s so over the top
I need you now
He yanks Wash back to an upright position and drags him out the infirmary door
The room erupts as all of the cadets start talking at once
Did you see that
What day is it
What day is it
That was the hottest shit I’ve ever seen
Wash sincerely hopes he imagined the Please tell me you got that on camera
Think they got the point
Tucker snickers as they stride down the hallway
Goddamn I deserve an Oscar
That was pretty smooth Wash admits
He snags Tucker’s wrist and pulls him into another kiss a real one with no one watching and when they pull away Tucker is a little breathless
Yeah
My hotass brain make you hot Wash
As it turns out it does
We’re not gonna keep getting this lucky Tucker whispers later much later
They’re in Wash’s room this time and his head is on Wash’s chest eyes carefully canted away as he says it
Not that this week has been fucking lucky butwith these missionsit’s gonna be one of our guys sooner or later
Wash sighs tilting Tucker’s face up so their gazes lock
No it’s not
Wash
It’s not
Wash takes a breath and kisses him hard
You’re all making it out of this
One way or the
We’re all making it out of this
I what
You didn’t include yourself
If we’re all making it out of this then so are you got it
Got it Wash says and Tucker surges up to kiss him this time
Good
It’s the calm before the storm he thinks this thing with Tucker and their seemingly endless supply of luck
He wants to keep them in it all of them as the world whips by the danger forever out of reach
What would that look like
He wonders suddenly as Tucker pulls Wash on top of him
What would his world even look like without danger and armor and endless conflict
Who is he without his guns
You’re thinking too much Tucker murmurs teasingly in his ear and Wash shoves his thoughts down hard
There will be time to figure the after out but he wants to stay here in the now
Tucker moving underneath him grinning into his kiss hands so warm on Wash’s skin in the eye of the storm the calmest he’s had in a long long time
Tucker knows it’s going to be a bad day when he wakes up to the sound of Wash yelling the walls down
The two of them hadn’t spent every night sleeping together since they’d started going steady as Tucker kept jokingly calling it but they’d spent enough
Tucker was starting to get used to the way Wash would fidget and jerk before lapsing into a full-blown nightmare and was usually able to wake him up eventually
Wash had either skipped the fidgeting tonight or Tucker had been so deeply asleep that he’d missed it completely
Regardless Wash’s scream hits him like a bucket of cold water jerking him back to consciousness before he’s aware of what’s happening
Wash has the sheets twisted up around his chest howling as if someone’s lit the bed on fire
Tucker lunges for him without thinking every instinct and lesson he’s learned over the past few weeks overridden and refocused into a single impulse wake him up
Wash
Tucker grabs his shoulders shaking hard
Wash wake up wake up wake up
He does and Tucker is met with an unhappy reminder of just why shaking Wash awake is a bad idea
Wash’s hands snap up and fasten around his arms and before Tucker can make heads or tails of the situation he finds himself pressed back into the mattress with Wash leaning over him
Shit shit shit
Wash’s eyes are blank and unseeing his hands gripping tight enough that they’re probably going to leave bruises and yeah Tucker really doesn’t want to deal with the fallout from that
Listen man I’m all for getting a little rough and rowdy but it’s like ass-o-clock in the morning and I’ve gotta go on that mission and be a badass later somaybe another hour of sleep and then you can give me a good luck blowjob
Wash’s hands stutter on Tucker’s arms and Tucker reaches his own hands up to squeeze Wash’s elbows as best he can
Wash
Come on wake up
You’re fine
Everything’s fine
You’re on Chorus in my bed with my fine ass and
Tucker
Wash’s voice is small and brittle and Tucker gives his elbows another squeeze
Bingo
You okay
Tucker Wash says again louder this time and lets go of him immediately jumping away to the end of the bed as if burned
Tucker
Are you
Did I
The door to his room crashes open sending both of them to their feet squinting against the sudden light spilling from the hallway
Carolina is standing backlit in the doorway pistol up and body taut
Tucker watches her scan the tiny room before glancing between the two of them
Everything alright in here she asks carefully
It’s fine Wash says dully
Sorry Carolina
Tucker sighs when she continues to stare at them
It’s fine he echoes
Look there aren’t any mercs hiding under our bed
I just had a nightmare alright
Both of their incredulous gazes snap to him
Tucker can tell he hasn’t fooled Carolina for a second but she nods slowly
Try to get some rest Tucker
We leave in two hours
Sure you don’t wanna join us for some pre-mission relaxing time
Tucker calls as she leaves
Carolina doesn’t even deign him with a disgusted glance just pulls the door shut behind her with an irritated snap
Well guess our secret’s out Tucker jokes
Our secret was already out Wash mutters then turns abruptly reaching for Tucker
His hands pause just above Tucker’s shoulders hovering there uncertainly
Did Idid I hurt you
No Tucker says quickly
Dude stop
I’m fine
I did didn’t I Wash says his voice grim and laced with guilt
I’mI’m so sorry Tucker I Tucker groans
Please stop looking at me like that
Wash I’m o-kaaay
This time Wash says and the worst part is that he sounds so miserable it doesn’t even come out as dramatic
Don’t start Tucker says sharply
We’re skipping this part remember
We can’t skip this part
Wash turns away from him and rakes his hands through his hair
We can’t Tucker
This isn’t a problem that’s going to go away
I could’ve seriously hurt you
But you didn’t
But I could have
Wash turns to glare at him
Why didn’t you yell or or hit the wall to try to get someone in here
You can’t just try to snap me out of it on your own when I get like that
Which hurts Tucker more than it should because he thinks that he does a pretty good job of snapping Wash out of the bad stuff
Well ex-cuuuse me
I haven’t exactly taken a fucking seminar on how to snap my boyfriend out of his shitty PTSD night terrors
I don’t have PTSD
Tucker stares at him
Are you joking
Tucker
No seriously
Tucker catches his arm as he stalks by
Wash
Are you for real right now
He does have vague memories of Wash saying something similar on Rockslide
Tucker had found it odd then too Wash’s denial of something that was so serious but now now that he’s heard the stories and seen the nightmares it twists his stomach into knots
Look
I don’t what does it matter Tucker
Wash
He’s no longer looking Tucker in the eye the asshole
Of course it matters
It doesn’t
Wash tugs his arm out of Tucker’s grip and runs his hands through his hair again twisting the strands into spikes
It doesn’t
What matters is that I just
I just put my hands on you
I could’ve
Okay
Tucker reaches for him and Wash moves away again
Wash come on
Just look at me
I need to know that you’ll yell for help Wash says suddenly
If I grab you like that
Promise me
I Tucker huffs
Fine
I promise okay
I’ll scream my head off
Happy
Wash turns and looks at him then and Tucker doesn’t like what he sees in his eyes not one bit
Do you sleep with a gun near you
Yeah dude I’m in the military
Of course I sleep with a
Tucker breaks off horrified
Wash
I need to know that you’ll use it if you have to
Wash looks at him unblinking
If you yell and no one comes and I’m not waking up then I need to know that you’ll
That I’ll what he yells voice pitchy in the way he teases Wash for
That I’ll shoot you
Yes Wash says as if it’s obvious as if it’s the most obvious thing in the world
I need to know that you’ll protect yourself
That you’ll put me down if you have to
Tucker has to turn away for a moment to get his face under control
It’s too much the protect yourself the put me down as if Wash is a dog as if he thinks he’s nothing
Which he does Tucker realizes
Still
I wouldn’t have to put you down Wash if you’d just fucking fucking talk to someone like Grey or someone about this and she could maybe give you
I don’t know breathing exercises or
Tucker takes a deep breath running a shaking hand through his dreads and turning back around
But no you just want to fucking ask me to shoot you like I can like I would ever be able to do you know how fucked up that is
It isn’t fucked up Wash says stiffly For you to defend yourself
No
Are you fucking serious
Defend myself Jesus Wash
Don’t ask me to how could you ask me something like that and expect me to
Tucker please
Wash backs even farther away from him
Please
I need you to
I can’t
I can’t do this if I think I’m going to hurt you
You’re not
STOP
Wash screws his eyes shut
STOP SAYING THAT
You don’t know that you don’t
Do you know what it would do to me if I woke up and I saw that I had that I had
Wash
I won’t survive that Wash says hysterically hands fisting hard in his hair
I won’t
I’ll lose it I’ll lose my mind and you want me to to risk your life just because I because you you want me to wake up to your body and tell Caboose what I did
I won’t Tucker I won’t I’ll blow my own brains out right then and there I swear to God I won’t make it I won’t risk it I
Wash
Tucker surges forward fastening his hands around Wash’s wrists
You’re hurting yourself
Stop
I don’t care Wash says viciously
I don’t care
Well I do
Tucker tightens his grips and pulls Wash’s hands away from his hair
Stop freaking out and sit the fuck down
Come on
Wash’s body is tense and stiff but he allows Tucker to pull him back over to the bed
He crouches in front of Wash still holding tight to his wrists
Will you please look at me you idiot
It takes a moment but Wash does his face drawn and miserable
I’m okay Tucker says and when Wash snorts and starts to pull away Tucker redoubles his grip
No Wash I’m okay
I’m right here
I don’t know if you understand how serious this is Wash says his words tumbling out in a rush
I don’t when I wake up like that I
I don’t know where I am or who I am orwho you are
I know
I could kill you
I know that too
Tucker raises an eyebrow when Wash frowns
What you think I’m just gonna leave
Tell you to get the fuck out
Well think again
I’m not fucking going anywhere
I can handle this
I won’t like lean over you like that again and I’ll yell for help and
And you’ll hurt me if you have to
Wash
Tucker
They glare at each other
Dude that’s not you’re so fucking that’s not the solution here for me to fucking shoot you
You just have to talk to Grey or someone about this she can help you
I’m not taking sleeping pills Wash says his voice rising
I’m not I can’t they
I don’t mean sleeping pills
I meanyou know
Therapy
Something closes off in Wash’s eyes
I don’t want therapy
Why not
I just look Dr Grey has more important things to do than talk to me about all the shit I’ve done
All the shit that was done to you
Wash blinks at him
What
Tucker sighs
Look man I know you’re all about owning your past sins but you went through some pretty fucked up bullshit that wasn’t your fault
You do know that right
Wash dodges the question
It doesn’t matter
I don’t need therapy
Britton needs therapy
She’s fifteen and just lost her arm in a war she has no business fighting
Kennedy needs therapy
Jensen needs therapy
I’m not
I have no right to take attention away from these kids
Wash seriously
Tucker squeezes his wrists again thumbs rubbing circles against the pulse points
It isn’t that big of a deal
Dr Grey can spare two hours or so a week to just help you get a handle on some of this
Wash says nothing just shakes his head and Tucker drops his head on top of Wash’s forearms
Look he says
Look
I want
I want you
And I’m not fucking going anywhere and I’ll listen to anything you have to say
But I can’t help you on this ya know
You gotta talk to like a fucking professional here
You need some help
The silence stretches on and on until Tucker feels Wash curl over him
I’ll think about it
Tucker looks up
You will
Wash hesitates but nods
I’ll think about it he repeats then stronger
I don’t want to hurt you
I know
You do help Wash says suddenly
Even beforethis
You’ve always helped
Tucker’s chest lights up at those words and he finally stands pressing a kiss to the top of Wash’s head
Anytime dude
You just you gotta learn that it’s okay for ask for help and shit
The look that Wash gives him suggests that this is a foreign concept but he nods
I’m sorry
I didn’t you’ve got a mission in a few hours you should be sleeping
It’s cool dude
Tucker yawns and climbs back into bed
Hmm
You wanna talk about it
About the mission
Nooo
Tucker tugs Wash down next to him
About your nightmare
No Wash says quickly
No it doesn’t matter
You sure
I’m sure Wash says
He lets Tucker tug him back against his chest
It wasn’t real
They never are
Tucker buries his face in the space between Wash’s shoulder blades and sighs
Alright dude
Let’s go back to sleep
Wash is tense and fidgeting in his arms at first but relaxes bit by bit
His body is cool always so cool and it feels nice against the heat of Tucker’s chest and within ten minutes Tucker is asleep
To his slight surprise Wash apparently fell asleep too
Tucker wakes up before him for once and he dresses quietly
Wash doesn’t need to be up for another three hours but Wash stirs anyway throws back the covers and starts getting dressed
Dude no Tucker protests
You’re not even going on this mission sleep in for once
I want to talk to everyone before they go Wash insists already halfway into his Kevlar suit
You know Carolina’s coming on this mission with us right
We’ll be fine
I know that Wash says carefully
I justwant to see everyone off
It’s a big deal
It is
Dr Grey’s realization that she was unable to fit Britton with a prosthetic right away led to the even greater realization that their medical supplies were dwindling
There was an abandoned hospital in the next city over Elodia and Carolina had reported back that it was well stocked
The city itself was nearly abandoned only a few pockets of civilians here and there
The planet had clustered together since the war had started forming little societies outside of Armonia
You’re sure no one’s using that hospital
Kimball had asked Carolina at least half a dozen times
Elodia wasn’t exactly thriving but it wasn’t abandoned on our last run there
We don’t want to take supplies away from anyone who needs them
The supplies are just sitting there Carolina had reassured her
Either we take them or Charon does
Which in the end had been the crux of the issue
I hate that I’m not going on this with you all Wash says now as they start down the hall towards the landing bay
They need you here dude
I know Wash says
I just still
I don’t like it
Tucker grins suddenly pulling him to a halt in the hallway
Is that why you’re going with me
You wanna see me off to war
Give me a big old kiss
Wash huffs
Tucker please
You dooooo
He backs Wash against the wall
You wanna see my fine ass off maybe have a quickie in the hallway before we leave and
Tucker we are wearing armor
We can work around that
Wash sighs pushing Tucker away gently and continuing down the hall
Alright war hero let’s go
Breakfast is a rushed affair but Wash manages to cram in a full lecture at their table in the time it takes everyone to gulp down some coffee and a few pieces of fruit
A couple of the Fed captains seem to be paying studious attention
Ali is actually taking notes and Simmons is nodding solemnly at every word but Tucker is pretty sure that the rest of the sim troopers are dozing inside their helmets
Wash continues on undaunted shaking shoulders and rapping on visors when he suspects they’re not paying attention
The lecture doesn’t stop until they’ve all shuffled down the hallway and are clustered around the Pelicans waiting to board
You’ve got that haven’t you Tucker
Make sure you watch your six you have a terrible habit of not watching your six in close quarters
Make sure you check your six or have your back to a wall
Okay
Okay Wash Tucker groans exasperated
I’ll watch my six or I’ll get someone else to do it
I mean who wouldn’t want that job am I right
He winks at Wash before realizing that he can’t see the motion and sends him a winky face text instead before turning to go
Before he can board the Pelican Wash’s hand closes around his wrist
He turns around surprised but Wash only clears his throat
Be careful Captain Tucker he says voice clipped and professional
Yes sir Tucker says in the least professional voice he can manage and Wash sighs letting him go
Will you hurry it the fuck up already
Grif groans from the top of the Pelican and Tucker takes off after him
He bows theatrically at the top of the ramp watching Wash shake his head in exasperation before the ramp seals itself
You know this is what you look like right
When you stare at Agent Washington
Tucker glances up to see Ali flipping his datapad around
It’s a drawing of Tucker sitting at one of the tables in the mess hall
He’s got his chin propped up on one hand and has a goofy moony grin on his face and is gazing at someone sitting across from him someone with fluffy blond hair
Wh it is NOT
Tucker sputters indignant
He makes a swipe at the datapad but Ali holds it away snickering
Dude
Not cool
I actually thought you were like taking notes on what Wash was saying back there
Oh man
Grif comes around to stand behind Ali peering over his shoulder
Dude he fucking nailed you
Did not Tucker grumps
You guys are assholes
I think it’s romantic Fitz says absently then glances up at the resounding silence that follows
What
It is
It’s sickening is what it is Grif mutters
Listen I know you’re jealous because I’m getting some and you’re not
Grif snorts
Oh yeah
Soooo jealous of the fact that you get to blow Wash
Super jealous
Uhhh I don’t know why you wouldn’t be have you seen his thighs
Because let me tell you
Oh my God please stop Simmons groans
He fumbles with his helmet jamming it onto his head to hide the spreading blush
Tucker you are shameless
Dude have you met me
Tucker glances around at them all and folds his arms
You can all rag on me all you want I’m not like embarrassed or ashamed so
Oh geez Grif sighs
Please don’t get all righteous no one said that like Wash isn’t a dirty little secret well there is plenty of dirty if you know what I mean
Stooooop Simmons moans
Tucker
Grif started it
I did not
Blame Picasso over here not me
All of you stop Carolina groans from the cockpit or I will make you
So will I Epsilon calls his voice pained
I cannot listen to this all the way to Elodia
Ali resumes his drawing to general snickering
Tucker huffs but after a few moments curiosity gets the better of him and he edges closer until he can see over Ali’s shoulder
It does look just like him Tucker has to admit and now that he has a closer look the expression on his face doesn’t look quite as pathetic as Tucker initially thought
He mostly just looks happy
Still though
Do I really look at him like that
Yep Ali says without missing a beat
But you should see the way he looks at you
Tucker snorts but he eyes the drawing again
Can you uh
Can you send that to me
I’ve never had anyone draw me before man that’s cool as shit
Ali tilts his head and Tucker can only assume he’s making a face
Ehh it’s not that good
It’s fucking awesome
Alright if you really like it Ali snickers
I could always put it up on Basebook so everyone can look at it
Don’t you fucking dare
Ali laughs again but makes a few final touches on the drawing before sending it to Tucker
Tucker files it away and continues to watch over Ali’s shoulder as he begins another drawing of what Tucker soon realizes is one of the alien towers the lines of his pen confident and sure
Dude this a fucking ghost town
Grif grunts next to him
Yeah
It’s pretty fucked up
It’s quiet Carolina says appearing next to them
Too quiet
Tucker exchanges a glance with Grif before they follow her approaching the doors to the hospital slowly
We’re clear she says over the radio
Set the Pelican down as close to the doors as you can get it
The Pelicans descend slowly around them
The city appears utterly deserted but recently so
There are no boarded up windows or debris in the streets it looks as if everyone has simply vanished without a trace
Creepy Simmons mutters and Tucker has to agree
They advance towards the hospital nonetheless and get to work on clearing the building
It’s a long tense process filled with more than a few false alarms two of the cadets bump into each other around a corner and scream so loudly that Tucker is convinced he lost ten years off of his life
Kimball comes tearing into the hospital at the sound of their yelling despite protests from Carolina that the building isn’t clear yet
The get a lecture from Perry on the proper method of clearing a building and Perry gets a lecture from Andersmith on the proper way to give a lecture and Carolina snaps at them all to stop clogging up the radio with their chatter
By the time they move to actually retrieving the medical supplies a full hour has passed
Tucker wanders around one of the supply closets while Simmons rattles off a list of what he should grab off the shelves
No not that gauze he tells Tucker impatiently
The one in the red boxthe other red boxthe other red box
What the fuck does it matter what kind of gauze we bring back as long as it’s gauze
Tucker snaps finally locating the correct boxes and sweeping them into the bag he’s carrying
Well I assume that Dr Grey didn’t just make these decisions for no reason Simmons tells him snottily
Honestly Tucker don’t you know anything about battlefield medicine
No
And neither do you
I’ll have you know that I’ve studied extensively on the subject
So it goes
The process is long and tedious but overall it’s a resounding success
They’re getting a fuckton of supplies and Simmons is so overjoyed when Tucker stumbles across some of the equipment needed to make prosthetics that he instantly drops his know-it-all attitude
Still Tucker isn’t surprised when Carolina pings their shared captains channel
Nobody panic but we’re about to have company
The moment she says it Tucker can hear the unmistakable roar of approaching ships
He and Simmons rush to the window as one of them lands with a BOOM and Tucker finds he was mistaken
Not multiple ships
One ship
One motherfucking huge ship
They watch as several soldiers spill out wearing armor that Tucker doesn’t recognize
Maybe Simmons says hesitantly
Maybe they’regood guys
They are dispelled of this happy thought as the newcomers immediately open fire on their own soldiers on the ground
Tucker and Simmons shove away from the window as one and tear through the hallway leap down three flights of stairs and come spilling out of the hospital just in time to see two more soldiers descend from the Pelican two soldiers wearing familiar colors
Felix Tucker spits
And Locus
Motherfucker
A grenade drops only twelve feet away from them and Tucker and Simmons dive in opposite directions
Tucker lets the roll carry him to his feet drawing his sword and activating it with a hiss
He spins locates the first soldier with that unfamiliar mismatched armor and jabs it right through his chest
Carolina who are these assholes
I’m not sure
Everyone take out as many of them as you can but get the soldiers and that equipment onto the Pelicans and get out of here
We need those supplies
I’ve got eyes on everyone I’ll cover you as best I can
Tucker can tell from the almost undetectable sulk in her voice that she isn’t happy about it
She’s torn Tucker suspects between wanting to be in the thick of the action and being able to call the shots from above
We got this don’t fret Tucker says
For a while they do have it
The fighting quickly deteriorates into guerilla warfare both sides holed up in various alleyways and buildings and Tucker can only be grateful that the newcomers’ armor makes them so easy to tell apart
Tucker’s just finished wrenching his sword out of another hostile’s throat when he hears a cry of pain and spins just in time to see Perry collapse into the dirt
No
Fuck fuck somebody cover me
Tucker yells over the radio and goes sprinting towards Perry
Somebody must be listening because the next soldier who raises his gun at Tucker falls almost immediately
Perry has both hands pressed tight to his abdomen which is gushing blood with no signs of stopping
Tucker drops to his knees next to him padding frantically around for the biofoam
Used it all Perry mumbles and Tucker yanks out his own biofoam canister before Perry has even finished speaking plunging it down into his gut
The wound is large and deep and Perry cries out as the foam spreads throughout the wound
It takes Tucker’s entire canister but the bleeding stops leaving Tucker’s gloves stained and Perry stirring weakly
Hey hey stay with me dude He raps on the side of Perry’s visor
Come on pull it together
I don’t think I’m gonna make it Perry slurs up at him like they’re in a fucking wartime movie or some shit and nope Tucker is having absolutely none of that today
Shut the fuck up
Tucker unsnaps Wash’s healing unit from his armor and slots it into Perry’s
Don’t be so dramatic Jesus
Perry groans with relief almost immediately and lets Tucker pull him to his feet
He sags heavily against Tucker boots dragging in the dirt but Tucker’s able to get him onto the nearest Pelican
Wash is gonna be pissed at you he mutters for giving this to me
I don’t need it Tucker says shortly
You do
You’ve got a hole in your gut so stop complaining and lay down
He settles Perry down on the floor of the Pelican where a handful of other wounded soldiers already are
Tucker opens his radio again
Alright we need injured on this Pelican and we need this Pelican gone
Pelican C closest to the hospital
Let’s get moving
A handful more soldiers come stumbling over dragging their comrades and Tucker stands watch at the foot of the ramp
He snags the last Fed who comes carrying one of the cadets on her back
Can you fly
Of course I can fly Captain
Great
You’re the new pilot on this bird
Bring ‘em home
She gives him a salute
Tucker is still not used to that and closes the ramp behind her
The Pelican takes off into the air and Tucker turns back into the fray
A bullet whizzes so close to his helmet that Tucker can almost feel it and he whirls to meet his attacker
The soldier lifts their rifle and Tucker lunges in canting his body off to the side until he can get one hand around the gun and the other around the soldier’s wrists
He twists the gun out of their hands angles it and
A sharp and sudden pain lances through his thigh bringing him down to one knee
Tucker lets out a startled scream but there’s no time to look as the soldier advances on him
Pure instinct has him bringing the pistol back up to bear and pulling the trigger
The soldier falls with one shot a smoking hole in the center of his visor
Tucker remains frozen gun up and glancing around but his area appears clear
He lets out a shaky breath glances down at his throbbing leg and there embedded halfway in his thigh is a knife
For a few seconds his brain doesn’t even register what he’s seeing
The sounds of the battlefield dim to a dull roar as Tucker’s bones turn to jelly and he scuttles backwards into an alleyway as if he can move away from the situation
His back hits some sort of wall teeth chattering in his skull breath rattling in his chest hands shaking shaking shaking
He tries to clench them into fists but they’re not listening not doing what he wants them to do
Tucker
Captain Tucker
What’s going on
Carolina’s voice cuts slowly through the fog in his head
It takes Tucker another few seconds to realize he’s muttering hysterically to himself a constant stream of ohhh fuck fuck oh fffuck and that it’s transmitting over the radio
Tucker
Talk to me
Knife he gasps
I
I
Iffffuck Carolina I got hit k-knife in my leg Okay Carolina says
Tucker just hang on
Grif what’s your status
Little busy
Grif yells over the radio
Get unbusy
You’re the closest and I need you to go to Tucker’s position and get him to the Pelican
Tucker where is the knife
What part of your leg
My thigh Tucker says his voice too bright even to his own ears
I’m finejust gonna get my biofoamand Tucker no Carolina says
You need to leave that knife where it is until a doctor can take it out
If it’s in your thigh there’s a good chance it’s on your femoral artery and
Yeah fuck that Tucker says patting around for his biofoam
It takes him several seconds of checking and re-checking the pockets and compartments on his armor to realize that he’s out of biofoam
He’d used it all on Perry and for all he knows Perry is dead on the Pelican
Panic seeps into the edges of his brain
I’m out Tucker says cutting through the chatter on the radio
I’m out of
Carolina I’m out of biofoam I
Tucker just find cover and try not to move that leg Carolina says
Grif
I’m going I’m going
I can pack it with something else Tucker says wildly
I
I can use someone’s fucking shirt or
No
Carolina’s voice comes more urgently now
No
Listen to me you cannot pull that knife out
You have no biofoam and even if you did you could do some serious damage
Felix pulled the knife out Tucker says
His brain feels oddly blank and small
He he pulled it right out of my guts and I was fine it’s fine it’ll be fine Carolina
Tucker Grif is on his way just breathe and
I am breathing
He clenches his trembling hands into fists and sucks in a breath
His hands won’t stop shaking no matter how hard he clenches them but they have to stop shaking because he has to pull this knife out it can’t stay there he can’t look at it for another second or he’s going to lose his mind
He’s just wrapping a shaky fist around it when Grif comes skidding around the corner at an impressive speed
Whoa whoa whoa
Grif crouches down next to Tucker and wraps a hand around Tucker’s wrist stilling the motion
Uh did you not fucking hear what Carolina just said
Don’t even think about it
Get the fuck off of me
Tucker reaches his other hand down towards the knife but Grif bats that one away too
Tucker thrashes and he lets out a yelp as the knife shifts painfully
Grif
I gotta
I gotta get it out it hurts it fucking hurts
It’s gonna hurt worse if you’re bleeding out all over the fucking ground
Grif gets a hand under the chin of Tucker’s visor and jerks his head up
And don’t fucking look at it
Pull your shit together
Tucker grits his teeth staring determinedly up at the sky
Grif I’m gonna fucking lose it I swear to God
Stop being such a big baby Grif snaps
I can’t get you out of here if you’re freaking out like this
Tucker tries to suck in another breath but it’s as if he’s forgotten how
He clutches hard at Grif’s forearm and Grif gives a firm pat to the side of his visor
Tucker
Jesus breathe
In and out and all that shit
Come on
You boys need to get on another Pelican Carolina says her voice clipped and terse
We don’t have much time
We got it we got it Grif says impatiently
Do you see what I’m dealing with here
Tucker closes his eyes as Grif rifles through the compartments on his armor
If he keeps them closed he doesn’t have to see the knife or the blood or the smoke or watch as Grif winds a bandage around his thigh as best he can the white gauze instantly turning red
He lets Grif slide one of his arms under Tucker’s shoulder and pull him slowly to his feet
Tucker grits his teeth and tries to stand on but even minimal weight on his busted leg has him sagging against Grif
Can’t walk he gasps
Grif just fucking pull it out just do it
Don’t you dare Grif Carolina snaps over the radio
Carolina
Alright everyone stop
Grif blows out a breath
I can’t carry him
Not without fucking up his leg even further
I need someone else over here
I’ve got him
Kimball’s voice sounds over the radio at the same time that she rounds the corner
Alright Captain Tucker
Fuckin’ peachy Tucker gasps as she slings his other arm around her shoulder
Just great
We’ll get you out of here she promises
Grif let’s get his legs on three
One two Tucker tries not to cry out as they lift his legs suspending him in between them but he doesn’t entirely succeed
General be careful down there Carolina says
I don’t know how many hostiles there are but your quadrant is crawling with them
Stick to the southeastern edge of the rock wall and the snipers can cover you from up here
I’m coming to you
Can you do it quickly
Grif grunts
Because Tucker here weighs about a million pounds and where are we even taking him anyway
One of the Pelicans Kimball says tersely
I called in for back-up
Medical and artillery
We’re overwhelmed
Carolina’s right this place is crawling with hostiles and I don’t even recognize their armor
Tucker sees her point about being overwhelmed when they duck out of the little corner he’d wedged himself into and back into the main action and come face to face with one of the enemy soldiers
Before any of them can react the soldier’s body goes limp crashing hard to the ground
Sniper Kimball says by way of explanation
One of ours
I would hope so Grif says
Let’s hope their snipers have shitty aim
Get back
Get back
Carolina appears out of nowhere an aqua blur skidding to a halt next to them
Kimball and Grif jerk him back to their little alcove and great they’re back exactly where they started
Carolina makes short work of the enemy soldiers near them before approaching
It’s too hot out there she says
The Pelicans are a no go
You’ll have to hole up here for a while
Fine Tucker grits
F-fine I don’t care just look if we can’t get to any of the doctors then someone take this fucking knife out of my leg before I scream
No Carolina says shortly glancing at his thigh
Absolutely not
That definitely needs to be taken out by a doctor
Which apparently you are now since it seems like you’re a fucking expert
The hospital Epsilon says suddenly popping up next to Carolina
The hospital
There’s a fuckton of room in there
We get Tucker in there broadcast a code red over the radio and have one of the doctors come to him
The hospital Grif says flatly
As in the hospital we just came out of
Tucker groans
Look we can go to the fucking moon for all I care just let’s just go and get a goddamn doctor over here before I rip this thing out of my leg myself
They make it out of the overhang and back through the hospital doors with no problems
Tucker had after all only gotten a few dozen feet out the goddamn door to begin with
Kimball and Grif set him down just inside the door and the moment they lift Tucker’s arms from around their shoulders he lunges at the knife
Grif’s hand shoots out to grab his wrist and behind the haze of panic and adrenaline Tucker is impressed he doesn’t think he’s ever seen Grif move so fast in his life
You idiot
Don’t
Tucker groans pressing his head back hard against the wall where they’ve leaned him up
Guys I swear to fucking god
Jesus has he been whining like this the whole time
Epsilon quips
More or less Grif says
He’s still got a firm grip around Tucker’s wrist
That’s Blue Team for you always fucking whining
Epsilon makes an indignant noise
Uh you know I’m Blue Team right
Like I said that’s Blue Team for you always fucking whining
So these new soldiers Carolina says loudly
She’s posted up on one knee in the open doorway pistol at the ready
Any idea who they are or where they came from General
I’ve never seen them before Kimball answers
She slams a new mag into her pistol and takes the other side of the doorway
And their armor Looks like shit Grif offers
He shrugs when they both throw him a glance
It does
None of it matches let’s all be grateful Donut isn’t here to see that by the way
It looks like they scavenged it
Carolina and Kimball exchange another glance this one slower and more serious
It does Kimball says
Which begs the question where did they scavenge it from
And why did they have to
Probably didn’t have legal access to it Tucker gasps
He keeps his gaze determinedly forward
They probably weren’t supposed to have it
Or something
Whatever
I don’t like it Carolina says before emptying half of her clip into what Tucker assumes to be one of the aforementioned asshole soldiers
I don’t like it at all
Know what I don’t like
Tucker grits out
Gee Grif says sarcastically
I wonder
Grif’s voice cuts out with no warning
Everything cuts out sound and sight and sensation
When Tucker comes to he’s lying on his back with Grif half on top of him the fuck was that
Grif is yelling
There’s something raining down on them and it feels like they’re underwater and the air is hazy and
Bomb Tucker gasps as it becomes clear that the things falling on them are pieces of the ceiling
A fucking bomb Grif agrees grimly
A goddamn fucking
Grif cover the door
We have hostiles incoming
With a curse Grif rolls off of him and half stumbles half crawls to the door
Tucker turns his head to track the movement the simple motion taking far more effort than it should and sending a wave of nausea through him
Bomb he mutters again then blinks glancing around more frantically
Kimball and Carolina are presumably outside and Grif is edging closer and closer out the door and there’s no one else here and this fucking knife is still in his leg
Grif wait
I’m right here Grif yells
Just hang on gotta take these fucks out they just keep coming
Tucker tries to pull himself up and fails miserably
Grif is out of sight the nearby sounds from his pistol the only thing suggesting that he’s near
The plaster is still raining down on Tucker’s faceplate at an alarming rate the smoke swirling thickly around him
A glance downward confirms that the hasty bandage wrapped around his leg is leaking and the blood sends a fresh wave of adrenaline through his body propelling him to a sit
Tucker leans against the wall and pants trying to get his bearings as the ceiling falls down around him and the smoke thickens and the blood seeps through the bandage and he gags around the nausea his hands fumble for the knife but they’re not working and he can’t he can’t
What if I die here he thinks wildly
He hadn’t realized how much the appearance of Grif and Kimball and Carolina and even Epsilon had calmed him until they’d left the room and he was alone with this knife in his leg what if he died here and no one found him and he was trapped under the falling rubble and he couldn’t get the knife out couldn’t get the knife out couldn’t get the knife out
It’s about fucking time he’s in there
Tucker
For a moment Tucker thinks he’s dreaming as Wash’s voice cuts through the smoke
Tucker has to blink several times to focus it looks like Wash’s armor and it sounds like Wash’s voice but
You’re s’pposed to be in the Capital he mutters as Wash kneels next to him
Those’rr the rules
General Kimball called for backup Wash says his hands passing over Tucker’s body
Dr James
Tucker catches Wash’s wrist and squeezes with a frown
You feel real
Wash drops his other hand onto Tucker’s forehead
I am real
We’re going to get you out of here
Coming coming hero coming through Dr James edges into his line of sight
Tucker knows that name knows that voice she was the one who’d patched his head up after freckles shake and the collapsed tunnel
He watches her crouch down with a growing sense of unreality
It’s good that she’s here becausebecause he needs a doctor because he’s hurt and because there’s a knife in his leg
Wash he tries to say but he can’t get past the first letter
He stops tries again
W-wash
I
I
I
Wash glances from Tucker’s face to the knife in his thigh to Dr James before returning to Tucker’s face
Tucker
Look at me
You’re going to be alright
Dr James is going to take the knife out
He glances back at her
Right
Oh yes she says examining the wound
If I pull it straight back it won’t nick anything
Of course I’ll need someone to stabilize the leg and you’ll have to hold very still
Despite this being the only thing he’s wanted for the last fifteen minutes Tucker panics grabbing at Wash’s arms
No
It’s fine you can just leave it in I changed my mind it’s fine I’m fine I
Tucker
No
It can stay there it he closes his eyes again trying to suck in a breath and succeeding only marginally
It’s gonna hurt
I know
He forces his eyes open to look at Wash as his hands cup around Tucker’s helmet
I know
It will hurt
But you’ll be okay
I won’t Tucker says aware that his voice sounds nothing short of hysterical but unable to do jack shit about it
I won’t
Wash
I can’t I can’t Tucker
Wash runs his hands over Tucker’s visor as if he can actually feel his face
You need to breathe
Count with me
One
Tucker shakes his head
He doesn’t need to count
He’s seen Wash count before
Counting means panic
Counting means going under
He’s not panicking he’s not going under he’s just
He glances down at the knife in his thigh and lunges towards Dr James when he sees her hands on his leg
No
No leave it leave it it’s fine I
Did I miss something
Grif’s voice sounds from somewhere above him and Tucker glances up to see Grif surveying the scene
You were two seconds away from ripping that knife out yourself and now you want to leave it in
Grif come hold his leg still Dr James says crisply
This is coming out now
Wash
Just give us a second alright
Wash Tucker tries to suck in a breath grabbing desperately at Wash
Wash
I---I
I feel like I’m dying I think I’m gonna die
You’re not dying Wash says firmly
His rubs his thumbs along the chin of Tucker’s helmet and Tucker pretends that he can actually feel Wash’s hands on his face
That always feels nice
Everything Wash does makes him feel nice
You’re just having a panic attack
Look at me and count
Don’t look at the knife
Okay
One
Count
He can count because Wash is asking him too and he trusts Wash
O-one
Good
Two
T-t-two
Three
Th
FUCK
There’s a sharp stabbing pain in his leg and he clutches harder at Wash glancing towards his thigh
Wash blocks his vision swiftly turning his face away
Really Doctor
You said three she tells him nonplussed and Tucker yells again the sharp sting of biofoam fills the wound air whooshing blessedly into his lungs
That wasn’t why I was never mind
Wash glances back at Tucker
Where’s the healing unit
I-I-I gave it to Perry Tucker says
I had to he was bleeding don’t be mad
I’m not mad Wash says
He’s still cupping Tucker’s face
I’m proud of you
Heard you got that Pelican out
Still got all f-f-fucked up myself though
That’s part of
Well if this isn’t just the most touching shit I’ve seen all goddamn day
Wash moves faster than Tucker’s ever seen whirling to a stand in front of the three of them rifle up
He fires immediately and the soldier leaps out of the way
Tucker doesn’t have to see the orange and grey accents to know who it is
Felix Wash growls
He slams a new mag into his rifle and stalks forward
Grif cover them
I’ll take care of this
Tucker takes a moment to reflect on what a crying shame it is that it took him so long to develop an appreciation for Wash’s battlefield voice and slowly pushes himself up to sit against the wall
Grif’s already on his feet cursing and firing at another soldier coming through the doorway
Dr James pulls out her own gun as well she actually looks like she knows how to use it and stands up in front of Tucker
Hey baby I’m the soldier here I’m supposed to be protecting you he protests weakly
Seeing as how he can barely keep himself propped up against the wall without sagging he thinks it might fall a little flat
Felix whirls back out from behind the corner and Wash’s next shot catches him right in the shoulder
He jerks hard enough to drop the gun which Wash kicks down the hallway
Felix instantly lunges in tackling Wash to the ground and sending his gun flying as well and then there’s the flash of something silver
NO
Tucker lunges away from the wall the pain in his leg a distant thing all that matters is that Felix has a knife and he’s going to
Except Wash catches Felix’s arm and pulls his own knife out of nowhere
He misses Felix’s neck by inches but Felix backs up enough for Wash to stand and then the world tips and sways
Tucker is dimly aware of Grif charging forward to tackle someone coming through the doorway
Dr James pulls Tucker back against the wall one hand on his shoulder and the other on her pistol
He watches Wash and Felix fight torn between terror and awe because now he can see can really see that Wash was going so easy on him in training that it was laughable
Wash isn’t good at knife fighting; Wash is amazing at knife fighting and it occurs to Tucker far too late that he should be recording this shit not even for spank bank material but because watching Wash move with a knife in his hand is a fucking work of art
Wash catches Felix around the midsection with a slash and Felix backs up cursing fluently
Motherfucker
You’re gonna fucking pay for that one Freelancer
Not unless you pay for it first Dr James says dramatically in a way that suggests she’s practiced this line in front of the mirror dozens of times
Tucker’s pretty sure the only reason her shot pings off Felix's helmet instead of punching straight through his visor is because Felix apparently decides that he has somewhere else to be and starts backtracking
Wash darts forward as if to pursue him but as another BOOM rocks the building he changes tracks and dives at Grif instead
He tackles him out of the way just as half the ceiling caves in and crashes down on the soldier Grif was just grappling with
Holy shit Tucker hears Grif gasp as Wash hauls him to his feet
Alright I owe you one
Just cover me while I get Tucker out of here Wash says grimly
Dr James you too
We’re on it Agent Washington Dr James says readying her pistol and coming to stand shoulder to shoulder with Grif
I think I can walk now Tucker mumbles trying to get his feet under him as Wash starts over in his direction
I can
He pitches forward woozy and Wash breaks his fall before scooping Tucker bridal style into his arms
Dude he protests
Seriously
I’ve got you Wash says in a voice that books no argument and also suggests that he will carry Tucker through hell itself if the need arises
Tucker can’t bring himself to look at Grif he’s never going to live this down but Wash isn’t even staggering under his weight
It is pretty hot and Tucker would be lying if he said he hadn’t fantasized about this exact scenario ever since he realized he was into dudes
Not that he wouldn’t be into a chick carrying him off the battlefield
Kai had been strong as shit and he was super into that but there’s something about the way Wash tucks him carefully against his broad chest that has Tucker feeling straight up warm and fuzzy
My knight in shining armor he mumbles at Wash right before he passes out
He wakes up on the Pelican to Wash’s face over his and an uncanny sense of déjà vu
Tucker jolts hands flying to his abdomen in a momentary panic before his memory catches up
The pain in his leg follows shortly
Wash’s face clears as Tucker squints up at him
You’re awake
Everything hurts Tucker grumbles then frowns reaching up to touch a gash on Wash’s neck
The fuck is that from
Wash smiles grimly
Felix and I went for round two
You kill the fucker
Unfortunately not
Wash reaches up to touch his neck absently
I repaid him in kind though
He’ll have a few new scars
So will I Tucker says his hand moving towards his leg
Fucked it up
Again
You didn’t fuck anything up Wash says sternly
From what I hear you saved Captain Perry’s life
Tucker perks up at that
He’s alive
He was the first one into surgery
Dr Grey says without the healing unit he wouldn’t have made it
Tucker allows the relief to course through him before shaking his head
Still
Backup had to comeyou had to come It wasn’t just you who needed backup Wash tells him gently
You were all overrun
I freaked out he whispered
I would’ve ripped that knife out if Carolina hadn’tif Grif They came for you Wash says the words falling from his mouth almost reverently
That’s what teams do
Coming from anyone else the words would sound absurdly corny
They still sound corny coming from Wash but they sound true too and Tucker nods his eyelids beginning to droop again
A flash of orange catches his eye and he reaches out his arm to snag Grif as he walks past
Thanks man
Grif’s helmet is off and he looks positively alarmed at the cadence in Tucker’s voice
Are you dying
No Tucker mutters
Not dying
Thanks to you
Oh geez Grif sighs
He shifts awkwardly but Tucker holds tight to his wrist
Really Tucker
Are we really having a moment
Saved my life Tucker says trying to make it sound gruff and dramatic like Wash would but failing miserably
Dude all I did was tell you to stop being a little bitch
They don’t hand out medals for that
They should
There
That sounds better
If Tucker didn’t know Grif so well he’d miss the almost imperceptible way his jaw tightens
Whatever
You’re welcome
I guess
He shifts casting a desperate look at Wash
How do you put up with this
It’s not always easy Wash says around a smile but I manage
Grif gives Tucker a hearty slap on the arm with his free hand
Alright get your goddamn beauty sleep we’re almost back
He doesn’t want to get his beauty sleep he wants to stay here with Wash’s hand on his forehead and Grif grumbling away and he has to thank Carolina too but sleep finds him nonetheless and he drifts off to the sound of Wash and Grif’s voices to the sound of his team carrying him home
Tucker spends the next week in the infirmary recovering from the stab wound to his leg
Wash does his best not to hover torn between acting like this isn’t a big deal and comforting Tucker who seems to want different things at different times
Day one the two of them have a long circular argument about whether or not Tucker should keep the healing unit with him to expedite his recovery
They compromise with the understanding that Tucker will keep the healing unit only if there isn’t a mission going on
Tucker spends most of day three cracking jokes about how he’s becoming a human pin cushion to anyone who will listen until Britton bursts into tears across the infirmary and Perry tells him off for being an insensitive asshole
On day five he mutters to Wash that they could probably both fit in the infirmary bed if Wash wanted to stay the night not that he had to just if he wanted to it wasn’t a big deal
To the delight of half the infirmary Wash shoves him over and climbs straight into the bed next to Tucker
His dignity has long since left the building and besides Tucker conks out against his chest in about five minutes and doesn’t move all night
That is the most romantic thing I’ve ever seen Kennedy whispers reverently from five beds over and Wash throws a pillow at him and tells him to go to sleep
The first day Tucker’s cleared for training he marches right into the training room and shoves Wash’s case of knives at him
Alright let’s fucking do this
Wash glances from the knives to Tucker’s face
Dowhat
Do our training Tucker says impatiently
For real this time
I know you’ve been fucking holding back on me when we spar
Ah
Of course I’ve been holding back Wash says
You wouldn’t learn anything if I didn’t go easy on you at first
Tucker snorts
You haven’t been going easy on me
You’ve been like completely toying with me
I was there when you and Felix had that little showdown remember
That was like some Matrix level shit you did when you Tucker makes a dramatic twirling gesture with his hands that Wash assumes is supposed to represent something he did during the knife fight
Tucker I have been increasing the intensity as you’ve gotten better which you have you know
Whatever
Tucker drops Wash’s gym bag on the ground and starts tossing stuff out of it until he finds the red chalk
He grabs two of the biggest knives he can find with blunted edges shoves one at Wash and keeps one for himself
Increase the intensity all the fucking way then
Wash eyes him suspiciously but there’s a surprising lack of fear in Tucker’s eyes
The fear is there Wash is sure but there’s a hard determination layered over it determination and somethingsomething playful
I want to not be afraid Tucker says bluntly when Wash continues to stare at him
I’m tired of being scared of this shit
Let’s just fucking rip the band-aid off
Please
There’s an honest vulnerability in his words that takes Wash’s breath away for a moment leaving him both indescribably proud and fiercely jealous all at once
The feeling catches him off guard so much so that he barely manages to bat Tucker’s arm aside when he lunges at him
Tucker raises his eyebrows
We gonna spar or are you gonna stand there and stare at me for the rest of the goddamn day
Wash pivots in with his own strike that Tucker parries
He catches Tucker’s blade with his own forces the arc of it up and gets in a light strike to Tucker’s abdomen
When Tucker brings his hands down instinctually to block Wash draws a long red stripe across his throat
Tucker flinches only minimally diving in so quickly that he very nearly catches Wash on the arm with his own knife
Good Wash says in approval
You used your speed that was good
Despite his best efforts Tucker still keeps dancing away from him constantly skittering backwards and out of reach
The fifth time he does this something clicks in Wash’s brain
You’re afraid to stay tight to me he realizes lowering his knife
Tucker follows suit waggling his eyebrows
Uh I promise you I’m not dude
He huffs when Wash doesn’t react
Okay well obviously why the fuck would I want to stay close when you’re waving a knife at me
Wash is already turning around rummaging in the training room closet
I can’t believe I didn’t think of this earlier he mutters half to himself
Let me just see if I can find a-ha
He emerges triumphant with a box of old leather jump ropes
Tucker stares at him as if he’s lost his mind
What the fuck are we gonna do with those
You’re fast but you don’t use it Wash explains as he fishes two of the ropes out of the box
You spend too much time moving backwards it wastes your energy your speed
If you stay close to your opponent then you’ll be able to go for the kill that much quicker
He ties two of the ropes together loops one end around his waist and gestures towards Tucker
Tucker eyes him warily but he approaches nonetheless and stares as Wash ties the other end of the rope around Tucker’s waist
So is this like some kinky thing you’re into or
Wash rolls his eyes
No
It’s look
You have to stay close now see
He backs away as far as he can and holds his arm out
Even at its fullest extension he can still touch Tucker’s shoulder
The rope keeps us close
Like a leash
Tucker asks
His voice is innocent but everything in his eyes screams DIRTY and Wash has to fight to keep the blush off of his face
Something like that he says and assumes his fighting stance
Let’s try it
Just like before okay
It’s awkward and clumsy at first
Tucker keeps trying to pull backwards dragging Wash with him in the process and they end up on the floor more than once
Yet the ridiculousness of the situation has Tucker relaxing in a way Wash hasn’t seen yet and when he finally finally lands a hit on Wash the comprehension dawns so clearly in his eyes that he actually gasps out loud
Holy shit I did it
Did you see that
I just
He gestures dramatically with the knife
And you just and I was close so it
Wash beams at him
You see
You’re fast
Fuck yeah I am Tucker crows and he moves in again
By the end of the hour they are both panting and covered in red chalk
Tucker reaches up and rubs his fingers through Wash’s hair snickering
You’ve got chalk all up in your blond-ass hair dude
That’s cute
Wh well you’ve got it on your face Wash sputters wiping his thumb along the side of Tucker’s jaw
Tucker turns his mouth to Wash’s palm and presses a kiss there
I geo it he says eyes bright voice bubbling over with excitement
I like
I really got it you know
I know
You did great you
I’m proud of you
Yeah
Tucker asks then grins
Yeah
I me too
Fuck me man I wasn’t
I wasn’t even scared
I was just focused and like ready to fucking go
There it is again the bold open honesty that leaves Wash breathless and envious all at once
Breathless because Tucker is beautiful in his bravery gorgeous in how he picks himself up time and time again
Envious because the honest way in which Tucker speaks about his struggles is a foreign thing to Wash and he wonders for the first time what he’s missing because of it
They spend the rest of the day barely able to keep their hands off of each other
Tucker is giddy and hyper from his success in the day’s training and Wash finds himself drawn to Tucker’s beaming smile like a magnet
Every abandoned hallway feels illicit every supply closet charged with electricity and the third time Tucker tries to drag him into one Wash plants his feet reluctantly
Later he gasps as Tucker wrenches his helmet off and starts necking him
Tuc kerlater
I have work to do
Tucker groans and pulls away
Okay okayokayokay
Fucking he jams his own helmet back on
Fucking message me the second your ass is free
That night when they finally find themselves alone in Wash’s room they can’t get each other’s armor off fast enough
The places where their skin touches burns so hot that Wash thinks he’s melting right into Tucker’s hands
Tucker’s touch is insistent and sure and Wash arches into it gladly
Mmmm Tucker sighs against his ear
He presses Wash a little harder against the door and tightens his grip in Wash’s hair
You like that Wash
Wash makes a strangled noise of assent and Tucker spins him around pressing Wash’s chest against the door
His teeth dig just hard enough into the skin of Wash’s neck just enough that Wash is pretty sure he’s going to have marks tomorrow
The thought sends a fresh wave of arousal through him and he paws at the wall for lack of anything else to hold onto grinding his dick against the door in front of him
He groans in relief when Tucker’s hand slides down to rub at him through his fatigues and he arches forward into the contact
Tucker grinds his own cock against Wash’s ass panting in his ear
Shit that’s hot he groans
God
Gonna fuck you so hard
Please do Wash gasps rolling his hips back against Tucker’s until the action earns him another one of those delicious moans
Yeah
Please
Tucker bites down hard on the shell of Wash’s ear
Wonder what else I can get you to beg me for
He pulls Wash’s body away from the door and they stumble towards the bed
Tucker twists one of Wash’s arms behind his back and pushes him face-forward onto the bed
He grips a fistful of Wash's hair with one hand and uses the other to pin both wrists at the small of Wash’s back
Wash struggles against the grip more out of instinct than because he really wants to break away but the shove has brought his legs up off the floor and he doesn't get very far
Something coils low in his abdomen at the feel of Tuckers hands holding so tight to his wrists and his hair
He tests the resistance but Tucker’s grip holds fast and it’s unexpectedly relaxing and pleasant and just right
Something liquefies in his spine leeching the tension out of his bones and Wash tests Tucker’s grip again it doesn’t break and that’s good so good Tucker’s mouth is back on his ear and they’d held him down just like this when they’d ripped Epsilon straight out of his head one hand in his hair to keep his head still and the other pinning his wrists and he’d screamed and Epsilon had howled and they’d held so tight to each other as he was torn out leaving something aching and bloody straight down the center of Wash’s mind and
Panic explodes in his gut and in his head all at once robbing him of his breath and for a few heart-stopping moments he can’t move
He could get out of this if he really wanted to he knows that but he limbs are frozen and he spends several more seconds struggling minutely before he manages to gasp "Tucker wait wait
" His voice comes out high and anxious and Tucker backs off immediately scrambling away from Wash as if he's been electrocuted
"Ah shit shit that was so fucking stupid of me fuck I'm sorry
I thought you liked it the other day when I
" Wash rolls over to a sitting position on the edge of the bed and shakes his head
"No
I did it’s it’s just
 just give me a second

" He hates the panic in his voice hates the tremors he can feel coursing through his body but most of all he hates the way that Tucker has retreated across the room from him as far as he can go
The space between them feels miles wide and Wash reaches out a hand hesitates then lets it fall
"Fuck me" he groans and buries his face in his hands
He can feel Tucker moving back across the room towards him
The bed dips moments later and he hears Tucker’s voice
Hey
"I'm sorry" Wash mutters into his hands face burning with embarrassment
I’m sorry
"Hey
Don't you dare fucking apologize
" Tucker puts a hand on Wash’s knee and shakes
"Wash
Fucking look at me
" "I just

I didn't mean to
 it's not

" Tucker gives his knee a little squeeze
"Stop it
I'm sorry
I should've known holding you down like that would freak you the fuck out
" "No it wasn’t it wasn’t Wash lifts his head
He can’t look at Tucker yet and keeps his gaze forward
I did like it
I just wasn’t expecting it and I "We need safe word" Tucker says suddenly and Wash finally looks at him surprised
"Fuck I don't know why I didn't think of this before
We definitely need a safe word if we're gonna be doing this
" "A safe word
" "Yeah you know like a word one of us can say when
" "I know what a safe word is" says Wash and rolls his eyes a little
I have had sex before you know
Tucker grins
Oh trust me I can fucking tell
No confusion over here
I meant
 you think we need one
A safe word
" He doesn't say you want to keep doing this often enough that we need a safe word
Really
You’re sure
Tucker seems to understand the real question and his grin gets wider
"Oh we need one alright
I'm not even halfway through the list of things I want to do to you
" "There's a list
" Wash says trying to sound exasperated but he thinks it falls a little flat given the intrigue that’s coloring his tone
"Oh there's a list
" Tucker winks at him then his expression turns thoughtful
"So the word
What about a color
That's pretty standard
Red
I mean I don’t really wanna think about the Reds during sex so I think it’s pretty perfect
" "Red is fine
" "Okay so if one of us gets a little freaked out we just say red and the other person stops immediately
" Wash nods
"Yeah
That sounds good
" Tucker gives his knees another squeeze then pushes himself to his feet
"Hey
" He drops his forehead to Wash's cupping a hand over the back of Wash's neck
"I would never hurt you dude
You know that right
" "I know" says Wash and he does
"I
 trust you
" Tucker stands up stretching his arms over his head
Wanna go get some food
Grif says it’s taco night in the mess hall
Wash frowns reaching for him
We can still
I didn’t mean to we can stillhave sex
Tucker shrugs easily catching Wash’s outstretched hand and pulling him to his feet
Maybe after dinner yeah
I’m starving
Wash takes a moment to be grateful for the fact that Tucker is currently dragging him towards the door and can’t see his face
He doesn’t know what it looks like but he’s sure it’s moony and ridiculous and
Utterly absurdly madly in love
Wash knocks long and loud on Dr Grey’s door the next morning and waits until he hears her cheery voice beckoning him inside to enter
Even then he eyes the room suspiciously
Is anyone else in here
Dr Grey makes a show of looking around the room as well
Hmmmmm well unless I’m hiding someone under my desk then I do think we are alone Wash
I wouldn’t put it past you to hide Sarge under your desk he says calmly pulling out the chair across from her and taking a seat helmet in his lap
Dr Grey positively cackles her face lighting up in delight
Ooooooh you have been spending a lot of time with Captain Tucker haven’t you
She leans forward propping her chin up on her elbows
Tell me when did you two really find yourself in the throes for the first time
Wash has to think for a moment before he realizes what she’s getting at
I don’t know what you’re talking about
Oh I think you do
She gives him a look
Wash please
That kiss in front of Miss Britton and her friends was certainly not your first
Quite a performance though
I was rather impressed with your acting abilities
Wash is fairly certain that she’s fucking with him he and Tucker’s performance in the infirmary hadn’t even been soap opera worthy
It was a few weeks before that he admits then thinks
Uhthe 20th maybe
Don’t say anything
Of course I won’t say anything Dr Grey says sounded offended at the very suggestion
Goodness me you should have heard those kids carrying on when Britton won the bet
I’m fairly certain there’s a Basebook fan page for you two
She smiles at him
That was a very sweet thing you both did
It was Tucker’s idea Wash says quickly
He came up with it
But you went along with it Dr Grey tells him gently and for the first time Wash sees it really sees the effortless unconscious way in which he directs all credit away from himself
It reminds him of why he’s here and he refocuses fidgeting with the pens on her desk
Tucker seems to be making you very happy Dr Grey says casually typing something into her datapad
Her tone is light and inconsequential but she is watching him closely in between swipes on her screen
Yes Wash says
Start simple
Start honest
He does
I’m
I’m sleeping better with himthere but I still Have nightmares
Her voice is still casual and easy and Wash lets himself relax a little deeper into the chair
Yes
I thought you would Dr Grey says
Is that why you’re here
No Wash says slowly
Well yes sort of but He trails off thinking again of the way Tucker had held him down on the mattress
Of how it had felt good and how he’d felt safe until that memory had burst in with no warning
I think I have PTSD
To her credit Dr Grey does not sneer or roll her eyes for which Wash is endlessly grateful
She simply places her datapad down and folds her hands on top of it looking at him
Okay
Okay
Okay
Wash nods hands clenching around his helmet even as some of the tension leaves his shoulders
Let’s just rip the fucking band-aid off Tucker had said shoving the case of knives at him so bold and brave
He held me down Wash blurts
Tucker
Not not in like we werewere
Being intimate
He nods relieved
Yes
I liked it
A lot
But when they pulled Epsilon out they held me down like that and it

He breaks off shaking his head angrily
I can’t even have sex without
Dr Grey reaches a hand across the desk to cover Wash’s which he realizes belatedly he has started bouncing against the desk in agitation
Wash
He stops letting her hold onto his clenched fist
Anyway that was when I knew he says abruptly
I know it’s
I know it’s stupid
It’s not Dr Grey says
It’s not stupid Wash
PTSD affects many different aspects of your life and sometimes it’s the little things that hit the hardest
I hurt Tucker
He pulls his hand away and curls it against his chest
He woke me up while I was dreaming and II grabbed him
I left a bruise on one of his arms
I could’ve he glances up voice suddenly fierce
Don’t say it’s nothing
I’m not
I could’ve really hurt him
I know
I could have killed him
I know
He doesn’t understand that
He doesn’t Wash unclenches his fist running his fingers through his hair the strands catching in his gloves
I told him he has to sleep with a gun close so that if he can’t call for help then he can use it
Dr Grey straightens at that narrowing her eyes at him
Washington
It’s unfair of you to ask Tucker to do that if
It’s not unfair Wash says firing up at once
It’s not unfair to ask him to protect himself
She holds up her hand silencing him
It’s unfair to ask him to do that if you aren’t going to seek help yourself
Wash gestures around her office
I’m here aren’t I
Yes she says
You are
She smiles at him then
It’s not condescending or pitying or even sympathetic
She just smiles and in it he sees the woman who has become his friend the Doctor who put all the chips and wires back in their proper places inside his brain
Maybe just maybe she could be something else too
Maybe she could help him sort the boxes of memories and put them away for good
I don’t like therapy
He fiddles with the radio dial on his helmet
I it’s hard
It is she says encouragingly
It absolutely is Wash but you’ve already done the hardest part
You’re here
He nods
I know that I’ll have toto talk about the things that were my fault and what I could have done differently to fix them
She tilts her head at him a little frowning
What you could’ve
I’m sorry
What I could’ve done differently he repeats
You know different scenarios
Ways I could’ve handled things better
There’s the briefest look of alarm on Dr Grey’s face before she smooths it out
Wash
She hesitates
That isn’tthat isn’t how therapy works
Berating yourself with what-ifs it doesn’t help you heal
It’swell quite frankly it’s cruel
I’ve been in therapy before he says annoyed
And I know it isn’t easy but
When
What
When were you in therapy
After he gestures at the back of his head
After Freelancer
After Epsilon
That’s what your therapist did
Ran you through scenarios of things you could have done differently
Scenarios like they ran Alpha through something whispers in his mind something that sounds just like Epsilon’s voice
Wash pushes the parallel aside
There’s a weird panic rising up in his throat that he can’t quite name
I yes
He would ask where I thought I went wrong with Epsilon and with the project and what I could have done better
Who is he
There’s a sliver of steel in Dr Grey’s voice that Wash has never heard before
The Counselor he says blankly
The Counselor
Of Project Freelancer
The Counselor she says briskly
And how did you feel after your sessions with him
Wash doesn’t have to strain to remember that
Confused
Angry regretful
He hesitates before adding Sad
Dr Grey blows out a breath
There’s something he’s missing Wash knows and it’s setting his teeth on edge
What he asks urgently gripping his helmet tightly
What
Wash I’m not sure just how much these doctors she practically spits the word of yours were helping you heal
Doctor he says so fiercely that she frowns
Doctor
The surgeon who operated on me my nurses they saved my life
Not just physically
They kept the Director and the Counselor away from me long enough for me toto at least form coherent sentences
So this man who ran your therapy sessions the Counselor was trying to see you days after you had brain surgery
Yes
She’s still looking at him in alarm and it’s making Wash feel foolish
Look I know that he the Counselor was a liar
He and the Director manipulated all of us my friends the AI all of us
I’m not stupid I know that
So you know that you were being manipulated during these therapy sessions then
Wash falters
Well
I mean
The panicky feeling is back and he squares his shoulders leaning into it
Explain explain what you mean
Dr Grey seems to sense the panic in his voice because she faces him head on looking him in the eyes
Wash
I don’t have all of the details about your time in recovery butwhat you went through wasn’t therapy
Not in the slightest
Then what was it he interrupts impatient
I don’t understand what you’re getting at
Wash it sounds to me like you were psychologically abused
His mind feels oddly quiet at those words thoughts drifting across it like tumbleweeds
He grabs one latches on
Me
She nods still watching him closely
Wash you were all abused during the Project
You Agent Carolina the sim troopers all of you
And this having this man the Counselor speak to you about these events after a major surgery and trauma telling you it’s your fault asking what you could have done differently that’s not therapy Wash
That’s not how you heal
Wash looks at her
Looks at the pen in her hands the helmet in his own
Looks inward to the feeling of panic constricting his chest
Clenches it tight in his fists and turns it to smoke
He looks up at Dr Grey
How do you heal
Wash leaves Dr Grey’s office with his datapad clenched tightly in his fists examining the schedule she’s laid out for him
Twice a week
One hour twice a week early in the morning
Just talking she’d told him gently
Let’s just start there
Just talking
It doesn’t have to be in my office
It can be wherever you like
Somewhere you feel safe
The idea of talking about Freelancer and Epsilon grates his nerves in an entirely different way but in a perverse twist he’s almost eager for it
Maybe he could heal
Maybe he could box the memories up even tighter
Maybe he could learn to sleep really sleep and not have to worry about hurting Tucker
Maybe he could have a sex life without flashing back to the worst day of his life
Maybe he could figure out why he can’t stop thinking about Tucker’s hands around his wrists
The memory comes to him at the most inopportune moments
In the mess hall
In the middle of training
On a mission
It comes to him absently a warm buzz in the base of his skull and a low heat coiled in his abdomen
He wonders what would’ve happened if he hadn’t freaked out
If your PTSD hadn’t flared up Wash corrects himself a spoonful of oatmeal halfway to his mouth
Dr Grey had said it was important to try to trace these thoughts back to their source and he’s started to see what she means
It’s helpful somehow to have something to explain so many of his reactions
Not an excuse but an explanation
An explanation for so many things
He lets the thought flit past his mind before refocusing on Tucker and the weight behind his hands
He wonders if Tucker would’ve held him down the whole time would have fucked him with his hands wrapped around Wash’s wrists
He wonders if he would’ve found something else to hold him down so he could use his hands for other things
If he would’ve been gentle with his touches or if he would’ve gripped Wash’s skin hard enough to leave marks
If he would’ve talked the whole time
If he would’ve made Wash beg
Wash stands up suddenly his oatmeal untouched and his face hot
For a moment he stands there frozen helmet clutched in his hands and torn by indecision
This is stupid
He shouldn’t it doesn’t it’s stupid the way he can’t stop thinking about it about Tucker’s hands
About the way everything inside of him had relaxed and turned to liquid
Wash you were all abused during the project
The project the project the project
The goddamned project that had taken everything from him from all of them
Maine’s voice and South’s self-confidence and Carolina’s laughter
They’d taken his team
They’d taken his family
They’d taken Epsilon they’d taken Wash’s sanity they’d taken his ability to sleep and to trust and
They’re not taking this too
Wash sets his jaw and turns on his heel jamming his helmet on
He strides purposefully across the base hands clenched nervously at his side until he reaches his destination
He enters the weight room to find Carolina half out of her armor and doing bicep curls on one of the benches Epsilon perched on top of her nearby helmet
Um Wash says by way of announcing himself
Carolina throws him a half glance
Hi she says voice a little breathless
Did you want to work in a set
No Wash says and after a bit of internal debate unlatches his helmet
He turns it over in his hands a few times
I have a
Question
For you
Okay Carolina says
She lifts an eyebrow when he doesn’t answer
What is it
Wash clears his throat
Puts his helmet back on takes it off again
Sets it on the ground beside his feet and crosses his arms
So Carolina finishes her set and casts an annoyed glance at Wash
"Out with it Wash
" "I was hoping you could tell me" Wash asks in the most casual voice he can manage "where to find some good rope around here
" Carolina fumbles the weight she is currently re-racking setting it down with an echoing bang
Oh my God Epsilon says to no one in particular
This is all of my nightmares come true at once
Wash ignores him as Carolina spins to look at Wash
Opens her mouth
Closes it
Opens it again and says "How do you know about that
" Wash keeps his face and his voice as blank as possible
"Know about what
" Carolina stares at him
Wash stares back
She folds her arms across her chest narrowing her eyes
"What are you up to
" Wash shifts
"I mean do you want details or
" "Does this have something to do with where you went when you disappeared for nearly twenty-four hours last week
" Wash has to think for a moment to remember what she’s talking about before the memory comes back to him
He and Tucker had both had most of the day off at the same time and had taken full advantage
Still
"What that's not it wasn't twenty-four hours
" "It was pretty close
Grif says he finally found you skulking around the B-Wing and you came up with some lame excuse about weapons cataloguing
The weapons are in the F-wing
" Carolina raises an eyebrow
"Am I about to get the real story
" "I had to
 the weapons needed to be
 you're taking Grif's word on this
" "Wash

" Carolina sighs
"Look just be careful
" Her words catch him off guard
"What
" "Are you the one using the rope or the one the rope is going to be used on
" Wash is rapidly regretting ever starting this conversation particularly when Epsilon drags both hands down his visor
C please
You are killing me here
To Wash’s horror Carolina launches into full-on lecture mode
"Because if it's the latter then I really think you need to be careful
I’m not sure if you remember but you went out of your mind when they tried to restrain you after your reaction to the sedatives in Freelancer
Something like this could be very triggering for you you should only be doing this with someone you trust and
"Carolina
" Wash closes his eyes in embarrassment
"It's
 yes
It's someone I trust
" Carolina glares at him suspiciously for a moment before her face clears
"Ohh
" "What what does that mean
Ohh
" "Nothing
" She's already turning back to her weights
"Lower level storage closet F5
Use the red rope not the black
" Wash forces his face back into an expression of careful neutrality
"Okay
Uh thanks boss
" She rolls her eyes at him
"You're welcome Wash
"  Wash stands outside of Tucker's door that evening for several minutes twisting the rope around in his hands
Carolina's recommendation is good it's sturdy but soft and light
He knocks on the door and Tucker sighs from inside
"Who is it
" He pushes open the door and pokes his head in
"It's me
"  Tucker's face brightens in a way that makes Wash feel warm all over
"Oh great
C'mere
" He frowns at the look on Wash’s face
What’s up
" Wash clears his throat realizes he has no idea what he wants to say and ends up placing the rope in Tucker's lap without a word
Tucker blinks picking up the rope and sliding it between his hands
He glances up at Wash
"You brought rope
" He'd been hoping that Tucker would just sort of get to it and they wouldn't have to have any sort of Conversation but it doesn't look like that's going to happen
"Yeah
I thought we could
 try again
" "Try what again
" "Try

" Wash gestures
"Try whatever you were going to try the other day
" Tucker stares at him
Wash rubs a hand over the back of his neck
You know what never mind this is stupid
Wait Tucker interrupts comprehension dawning his eyes
"Wait you want me toto tie you up
" "Well

I mean

" the stunned expression on Tucker's face is unnerving him and he tries to backtrack
"Only if you want we don't have
" "Are you serious
Wash is starting to wish he’d never brought this up
Or been born come to that
Never mind I’m gonna go
Wait
Tucker snags his arm as Wash turns away
Oh my God don’t you dare leave
I just
Wash has no idea why he feels so nervous and flustered like a goddamned teenager before his first kiss but he finds it impossible to look Tucker in the eyes
This is Tucker he reminds himself
Just you and just Tucker
I just thoughtit might be somethingwe don’t have to if you don’t want to Wash please
This is like all of my fantasies about to come true at once
This is stupid Wash mutters at the floor and suddenly Tucker’s tilting his neck to meet Wash’s eyes
Hey
Why do you always say that
He sighs when Wash doesn’t answer tugging at his arm until Wash sits next to him on the bed
Dude
You’re being weird
What’s up
I don’t Wash reaches for the rope he’d placed in Tucker’s lap twisting it between his hands
I don’twant to make this all about me ormake you do all the workI’m not Uhhh if you’re thinking I’m not totally gonna get off on tying you up and getting to do whatever I want to drive you crazy you are like one hundred percent wrong
Wash feels something hot twist in his abdomen at the way Tucker actually shudders at the thought and it makes him feel a little better
Okay Tucker looks at him long and hard before taking Wash’s face in his hands and dropping a firm kiss onto the top of his head
Besides he murmurs into Wash’s hair
Why can’t it be all about you sometimes
To his absolute horror Wash feels his throat start to close up
I don’t know he says and that’s it that’s it right there
Tucker says nothing for a while just pulls Wash tight against his chest and presses another kiss to the top of his head
You can ask for good things you know he says after a while
Especially in the bedroom
Like I will literally fuck you any way you want
Wash laughs at that
Oh really
Yeah Tucker says
Nothing is off the table
You wanna do something you just say the fucking word and I will make it happen
You want me to tie you up
Done
You’re into video cameras
Fucking sold
You want to turn that threesome with Grey and Sarge into a foursome
Dude as long as I don’t have to kiss Sarge on the mouth then I’d be willing to
Oh my god please stop Wash groans but he’s grinning
He pulls away enough to tug Tucker’s chin down towards his own
The kiss is soft and sweet until it’s hot and dirty and Tucker’s murmuring the most ridiculous obscene things into his mouth and Wash starts laughing into the kiss
He’s still laughing when they pull away
Now Tucker says snatching the rope back from Wash
Down to business
Dirty business
The way more important question here is are you sure
"I'm sure
" Tucker eyes him
"Okay but you have to promise me something
" "Okay

" "You have to promise me that you're not gonna treat this like some kind of RTI training session
" That throws Wash off
"What
" "If we're doing this and you start freaking out don't push yourself through it because you feel like it's an obstacle you've gotta overcome or some bullshit
" "Iwouldn't do that
" Tucker doesn't look convinced in the slightest
"Because it's not
This is sex not like an interrogation
It's supposed to be fun
" "I know Tucker
" "I'm only saying
You weren't just uncomfortable when I held you down the other day
You were scared for a second there
We're not doing this if you're just trying to prove a point to yourself
" Wash flushes a little
He'd been seriously underestimating just how well Tucker knew him
"Okay okay point taken
But it's
 it's not that
" "So what is it
" "It's that I
 liked it
It caught me off guard when you did that but after I couldn't stop thinking about
 what would've happened if we'd kept going
" He nods at the rope
"So I want to find out
Tucker's still sliding the rope through his hands in a very distracting sort of way
"Okay
Just promise me that you'll use the safe word if you want to stop
" "I promise
" "I mean it Wash
If I find out later that you made me do something that had you panicking the whole time I will be seriously pissed off
" There's a sharp sensitive note in Tucker's voice that makes Wash sit up and look at him a little more closely
He reaches out and runs a hand down Tucker's arm ending with a squeeze to his hand
"I wouldn't do that to you Tucker
"  Tucker holds his gaze for a moment longer before nodding sliding his body behind Wash’s
Wash closes his eyes as Tucker's hands travel down his back and across his shoulders tracing circles as he moves them down Wash’s arms to hold his wrists and pausing there
Maybe I shouldn’t tie them behind your back
Did it freak you out not seeing me
Wash considers
I don’t think so he says slowly
I’ll know you’re there
And I’ll be able to hear your voice
Fuck yeah you will
Tucker bites playfully at his ear
You know I’m a dirty talker
Slowly slowly he draws Wash's arms behind his back starting to bind them at the wrists
He hesitates halfway through
Hmm
Aren’t there like all those artsy fucking knots and shit that we should be using
Maybe I should look them up
Don’t wanna cut off your circulation or something
I’m sure a basic knot will be
But Tucker’s halfway across the room kicking clothes and bits of armor aside until he finds his datapad
He bounds back on the bed and resumes his position behind Wash the datapad held in front of both of them and his head propped up on Wash’s shoulder
I’ve only ever used handcuffs Tucker explains cheerfully as he types something in and starts rifling through photographs
Like those pink fluffy kind
Smart idea bringing rope though
Handcuffs would probably freak you out right
‘Cause of prison and all that
Ohuh I guess
The thought hadn’t even occurred to Wash
In hindsight it seems rather obvious
He focuses on Tucker’s other statement instead
You’ve used the handcuffs on other people
Or on yourself
Both Tucker says absently
It was hot as shit dude you’re gonna love it
You’ve never been tied up before
I don’t think so Wash says feeling more ridiculous by the minute
Wait maybe
I think in Basic He shakes his head
The memory is too fuzzy
Don’t remember
Tucker asks
His voice is casual the note of sadness barely noticeable but Wash catches it
Don’t remember he sighs
I think you’ll be totally into it Tucker says enthusiastically
It’s like your brain just shuts right off
You fucking need some of that
Wash can’t really argue there
He watches as Tucker swipes around to various websites apparently intent on finding something specific
What exactly are you looking for
I don’t know man look at this one this is like fucking art right here
I think I need a video tutorial or some shitah here we go
Tucker props the datapad up in Wash’s lap tugs Wash’s shirt off and spends the next ten minutes trying to perfect the knot he’s chosen
He finally slides off the bed to stand in front of Wash
Okay test that
Can you get out of it
Wash does twisting his wrists and flexing the muscles in his arms but the knot holds fast
No
It’s good
Tucker snaps his fingers
Oh wait we need one more thinghang on Wash watches as he starts rifling around his room before unscrewing the metal lid to his canteen
He tucks it into Wash’s hands then steps back
Drop that okay
If you want me to stop
Tucker must see the confusion on his face because he tilts Wash’s chin up with his fingers and grins
In case it’s easier than talking
Besides I might have other plans for that hot fucking mouth of yours
Wash feels a powerful and unexpected heat flare beneath his skin
He realizes suddenly that has no control over whatever happens next and it’s a thrilling prospect
The control is gone placed in Tucker's hands and he feels equal parts arousal and surprisingly relief at the thought
Tucker pauses for a moment cupping Wash's face with his hands and pressing their foreheads together
"Got you
Okay
" "Okay" Wash whispers and Tucker smooths his thumbs over his cheekbones before leaning down to kiss him
For several minutes that's all they do but the kisses are deep and hot full of teeth and tongue
Tucker leans into him sliding his hands up the inside of Wash’s thighs
Wash closes his eyes as he feels Tucker’s mouth on his neck his ear the dip in his collarbone
Tucker’s hands slide up and down his thighs never quite high enough and soon Wash is pressing his hips forward each time Tucker’s hands drift back up
Tucker palms his cock lightly through his fatigues and hums a little
So fucking hard already he murmurs
His lips are right on Wash’s ear when he says it and everything in his body sways towards Tucker as he pulls away
Tucker undoes the button on Wash’s fatigues and tugs them off his legs Wash lifting his hips as best he can to help
He’s left only in his boxers now and ridiculously his socks but Tucker leaves those on
Holding his gaze Tucker kneels in front of him running his hands up and down Wash’s thighs once more
Tucker grins as Wash spreads his legs and squirms forward a little
Yeah just like that Wash spread your legs for me
His hands come down on Wash’s thighs and squeeze firmly and then he lowers his mouth to Wash’s cock and sucks hard
He’s left Wash’s boxer briefs on so Tucker’s mouth is right there but still too far
Wash whines hips rolling forward but Tucker just moves to the base of his cock and licks a long stripe up the sides before sucking on the tip of Wash’s cock
So close so close so close
Tucker he groans and moves to tangle his fingers in Tucker’s hair to tug him closer because Tucker loves that because he’s so close and Wash needs more
It takes Wash a few moments to realize through the haze of pleasure that he can’t move his hands that he can’t touch Tucker at all
He feels his first real wave of frustration as he tugs and remembers that he isn’t going to be able to touch Tucker’s gorgeous skin or hold onto his hair
Fuck he pants tossing his head and Tucker says nothing just smirks up at him and keeps mouthing away at Wash’s cock through his briefs
Tucker stays there until the fabric is soaked through
It feels good so good the heat of Tucker’s mouth and the drag of his teeth but it’s not enough
As if reading his mind Tucker hums against the base of his cock
Hmmm
You can come you know Wash
I never said you couldn’t
I can’t Wash groans
He thrusts desperately at Tucker’s mouth and Tucker lets him opening wider but Wash doesn’t get very far
I need
Tucker Tucker looks up at him slyly thumbs playing with the waistband of Wash’s briefs
What’s the matter
Want me to take these off
He nuzzles his cheek against Wash’s cock and Wash ruts against him
Yes he whines as Tucker nips at the waistband
Yes what
Wash bites his lip as Tucker rubs a thumb over the tip of his cock
Please he grits out
Tucker please
Tucker rewards him with a long slow stroke his palm firm and warm against Wash’s dick the most friction he’s gotten in a while before standing up
He drops his forehead against Wash’s for a moment before tilting Wash’s chin up so their eyes lock
Get on your knees
His voice is low and sure not a trace of his usual snark and Wash feels that liquid-smoke feeling in his bones again like they’re melting straight into the floor
He follows them down kneeling in front of Tucker who winds one hand in Wash’s hair to tilt his head back
Tucker lifts his other hand to Wash's mouth inserting two fingers and Wash sucks gladly
He moves his mouth to the heel of Tucker’s palm dragging his teeth there and is rewarded when Tucker moans hips stuttering forward
Tucker's eyes are bright when he pulls his hand away tugging his pants down and letting his cock spring free
He wraps a hand around himself stroking leisurely and holding Wash's gaze
Wash tries to maintain eye contact but the way Tucker is jerking himself off inches from his face is too distracting and his eyes constantly flit downward
"Suck
" He tugs Wash's head forward breath stuttering a little as Wash takes him in
The heat pooling in Wash's groin pulses hotter with every gasp and moan of pleasure that he coaxes out of Tucker
He squirms a little hips swaying forward to no avail as he tugs uselessly at the rope but the knot doesn't budge and Wash whines a little in the back of his throat
Being unable to touch himself is bad enough but being unable to touch Tucker when he's moaning like that is driving him insane
Tucker glances down at the noise pulling back out of Wash’s mouth
Are you
M’fine Wash gasps
M’fine swear just
God Tucker
Tucker grins tugging Wash’s mouth back on him once more
Wash swirls his tongue around the head of Tucker’s dick just the way he likes; he sucks Tucker into the back of his throat and hums there and Tucker moans and gasps and pulls at his hair as he comes
Wash swallows every drop licking Tucker clean and Tucker falls heavily to his knees in front of him
He tips Wash’s head back again and kisses him fiercely hands running down Wash’s arms to close over the rope
That was so fucking hot he mutters into Wash’s mouth
Here sit down dude
Gonna rock your fucking world
Wash does sitting back hastily on the floor and leaning his back against the bed
Tucker spreads Wash’s legs apart shimmies down until he’s flat on his stomach and pulls Wash’s underwear off
With an obscene smacking sound he takes Wash’s cock in his mouth and sucks him right into the back of his throat
Wash lets out a noise that sounds more like a sob than a moan pleasure arcing through him and setting his nerves on fire
Tucker tugs his hips forward even closer his head bobbing enthusiastically
He presses hard against the rope and hard against Tucker’s hands but neither give they hold him fast they hold him still Tucker’s mouth hot on his cock and when he comes he feels like he’s floating
It takes him several moments after to realize that Tucker’s leaning over him undoing the rope
Wash groans as the rope pulls free the muscles in his arms singing in relief
Tucker’s hands are strong and sure on his shoulders rubbing them gently sweeping down his arms turning his wrists
Thank you he mutters and then keeps muttering it
Tucker laughs dropping kiss to one of his shoulders before rummaging around in his locker
Drink this he says and Wash blinks blearily up at him
Tucker’s holding a water bottle out expectantly
C’mon sit up a little
M’fine Wash insists because really he’s so comfortable here leaning against the bed that he doesn’t think he’s ever going to move again but Tucker’s gently pulling him forward and pressing the water bottle into his hands
He drinks half the bottle and lets Tucker tug him back onto the bed flopping next to him
Tucker looks so delighted that Wash laughs
You proud of yourself
Fuck yeah I am Tucker says
He’s practically preening
You’re like fucking melting right now
Did you know you needed that
Like really needed that
No Wash says
Not like that
That was He breathes in deep rolling to kiss Tucker
Thanks he says again and drops his head right there on Tucker’s chest because the closeness feels good because it makes Tucker feels good because he can have this
He can let himself have this
If Tucker is being honest with himself truly unflinchingly honest he has to admit that he spends most of his time these days on cloud nine
He knows he shouldn’t really
The planet is fucked
The war is fucked
There are mercs out for their blood and probably also his head on a stick
People are injured
People are dying
Even if this war ended tomorrow putting this planet back together was going to take years
Yet shit is always fucked
It’s been Tucker’s baseline for so many years now that he doesn’t even know what he would do with some normalcy
There’d been a moment before the Hand of Merope had crashed that it looked like they might actually get a bit of that and Tucker would be lying if he said the prospect hadn’t terrified him
But nope
Back to the normal bullshit that has been his life since entering the military
So cloud nine
He gets regular updates on his kid and all of them are good
He’s finally making real headway in his knife and hand-to-hand training and he’d gotten to watch Wash thoroughly hand Felix’s ass to him on their most recent mission
He’s got food and a bunch of idiots to sit around in the mess hall and eat it with
He’s got a bed and someone to fuck and cuddle with in it
He’s got Wash
Ali was right Tucker thinks absently as he pulls up the drawing of him staring at Wash
He can feel it feel the stupid moony expression that his face seems to get stuck in every time Wash is around
Tucker feels like he’s single-handedly saved the planet and won the war every time he gets Wash to laugh or smile or come or sleep
Wash is happy too
Not always not completely but he smiles more these days than Tucker has ever seen before and he’ll be damned if he doesn’t do everything in his power to keep seeing that smile
A knock on the door has him closing the drawing and looking up eagerly from where he’s sitting cross-legged on the floor
Yeah
Donut pushes the door open peeking his head in
You called
Yeah dude
Tucker gestures for Donut to come in and close the door
I’m in way over my head here
I cannot figure this shit out for the life of me
Figure whatoh
Donut’s eyes flit between the datapad and the rope that Tucker is furiously trying to unknot
Well doesn’t this look fun
That’s the idea Tucker grumps as he somehow manages to get the rope tangled up even further
Ahh goddammit
Give it here
Donut takes a seat across form him tugging the rope out of Tucker’s hands
Soooo you’re trying to do what exactly
I’m trying to practice Tucker says with a sigh flopping on his stomach and swiping absently through the datapad
When Donut merely raises an eyebrow Tucker gives him a look
Practice making knots Donut
Sex knots
Jesus what does it look like I’m doing
It looks like you’re doing your best to destroy this beautiful piece of rope Donut says in disapproval as he unravels Tucker’s mess
I meant why did you call me in here silly
Because I need your help Tucker says desperately
You should’ve seen me trying to tie Wash up
It took me like twenty minutes to figure out a single knot
I mean talk about amateur hour
Unacceptable dude
Unacceptable
I need my shit to be on point
And I was the first person you thought to ask
Tucker huffs
Oh yeah let me just go ask Grif
Hey Grif
Can you help me figure out some sweet bondage techniques
Or Sarge
Or fucking
I don’t know Carolina
Donut beams at him
Tucker I’m
I’m just honored that you trusted me enough to come to me with this
I’d be happy to help
Oh good Tucker says gratefully
So you know how to do this shit then
Do I
Donut undoes the rope with a flourish straightening it out between his hands
Do I ever
Fucking fantastic
Tucker holds out his wrists expectantly
Show me the goods
Donut eyes him suddenly stern
You and Wash have talked about this right
Tucker blinks
What using rope
Are you serious
You think I would just try to tie Wash up without talking about it first
Come on give me a little credit
Sorry sorry Donut amends
It’s just it’s Wash
" Yeah I know
That’s why I’m trying to do this shit right
Donut’s eyes go downright misty
Oh Tucker
You’re sooo in love
Oh my God Tucker groans
Look either show me how to make some good sex knots or I’ll have to ask Grif about this after all
Fine fine Donut sits up a little straighter clearly his throat dramatically
Okay
So
Speaking purely technique-wise since I’m assuming you two have already talked about safe words and
Yup
Got that shit on lock
Then the first knot I’m going to show you is called a single-column tie It takes Tucker the better part of two hours to get the hang of the knots that Donut shows him but after the never-ending disaster that was his knife evasion lessons Tucker isn’t complaining
If there’s one thing this goddamn war has taught him it’s a bit of patience
He throws himself into the lesson rolling his eyes only minimally when Donut says things like Now Tucker it’s important to note that the actual tying of the rope should be just as erotic as the sexual acts themselves
I’m so impressed that you’re not just using handcuffs Donut gushes as Tucker practices looping Donut’s hands behind his back for the third time
Not that there’s anything wrong with that but this is so much more intimate if you ask me
Eh I’m cool with handcuffs but I figure they probably freak Wash out ya know
Prison and all that
Of course Donut says solemnly
He didn’t like that one bit when we were in that Fed prison
Neither did I come to that
They into a comfortable silence and Tucker feels a sudden burst of affection for Donut
Thanks he says clapping Donut somewhat awkwardly on the shoulder
For helping me figure this out
No problem
Donut says cheerfully
That’s what friends do
The wave of guilt that crashes over him is just as sudden as the affection but far more unexpected
Donut’s right
This is what friends do this is in fact above and beyond what friends do because Donut’s a pretty good fucking friend and Tucker Do you want to go find Doc
Donut pauses craning his neck around to look at Tucker
I’m sorry
Do you Tucker clears his throat resuming tying the knot and trying to sound casual
Do you want to look for Doc
I’ll help you
Oh my goodness
To Tucker’s horror Donut sounds on the edge of tears
That’s so nice of you
I should’ve asked you sooner but Wash and I have already looked for him so that’s my bad wait what
Mmhm Donut says cheerful as ever
I mean we didn’t get a chance to peek into every nook and cranny of the planet but we did spend a good few days looking
Tucker rifles through his memories trying to recall if there was a time when both Wash and Donut were missing for several days and comes up blank
When was this
While we were with the Feds of course
Tucker pauses in the act of unlooping his most recent knot
Wait what
They let you
Locus let you and Wash go off and fuck around for several days so you could look for your boyfriend
Don’t be silly Donut says with a tittering laugh
Wash and I busted out
With each new piece of information Tucker finds himself even more baffled
He finishes unknotting the rope from Donut’s wrists and comes to sit in front of him
Hold up
You guys did what
We made a break for it
Wash and I were bonding you know as men are wont to do when crammed together in tight spaces and we were talking about Doc and I got really really sad and Wash said well let’s go find him
Donut pauses for maximum dramatic effect before continuing
Sooo we busted out
Sarge and Lopez covered for us while we escaped under cover of night
We spent a few days looking for Doc and for all you guys of course
We thought you might be together actually but Locus caught up with us eventually
Tucker stares at him flabbergasted
How the hell did you talk your way out of that one
Wellllll there was a lot more fighting than there was talking at first but eventually we managed to convince them that we were out gathering intel
Donut pauses thoughtfully
I’m not sure that they bought it though
You think
Tucker says sarcastically
Jesus Donut
You’re lucky you weren’t both killed
Donut scoffs
Don’t you lecture me Lavernius Tucker
If memory serves me right you four were the ones who showed up at the Fed’s base
That was different
Was not
Was too
How
Itbecause itwe
Tucker narrows his eyes
It just was okay
The point is Donut continues we didn’t find Doc
Or you guys obviously
Or much of anything
But it was nice of Wash real nice to come with me
Yeah Tucker says his annoyance fading back into guilt
It was
I’m
I’m sorry man
I should’ve like asked you about this sooner
No need to apologize
Donut says cheerful as ever
I know you would’ve gone with me if I’d asked
I would have Tucker says quickly
I swear
Donut smiles at him then picks up the rope
Now come on
Do that knot again and this time make the experience more erotic
You’re tying up your lover not wrestling a crocodile into submission
Tucker rolls his eyes but snatches the rope
Fine
Watch the master at work
He pauses
And uh
Thanks again
Look if you ever need sex tips I could like show you some of my best blowjob techniques on a banana or something
Donut laughs a bright tinkling sound
Tucker please
Have you forgotten who you’re talking to
Ever since his breakthrough in knife work with Wash Tucker has been improving in his training by leaps and bounds
He still doesn’t like seeing that bright chalk marking his skin and he sometimes finds himself flinching but he no longer freezes up
His knives find the target more often than not these days and he feels like a mega-badass each time he hears that satisfying thunk of the blade finding its mark
Even his hand-to-hand skills are getting better
He still can’t best Wash or Carolina but he comes out on top in his matches with almost everyone else
Training in short is going great save for one key area
They still haven’t found anyone on this goddamn planet who knows how to use a sword
No Tucker Carolina says without even looking up when he approaches her in the mess hall one day
I still haven’t found a swordsman
I will tell you when I do
Ugh
Tucker throws himself into the seat across from her
I mean is there even anyone you haven’t asked at this point
Carolina grimaces
Not really
I can’t believe it Tucker grumbles
I can’t believe not a single person on this planet knows how to use a sword
Really
Epsilon quips popping up on top of her helmet
You can’t believe a single person on this planet doesn’t know how to use an ancient Sangheilli laser sword
Tucker eyes him
Uh considering that this place is fucking littered with ancient artifacts
Yeah dude
I confess myself a little shocked
Epsilon fidgets as if he’s going to fire back but hesitates
Things haven’t been the same between them since he’d shown Tucker his memories of Wash and every time Tucker opens his mouth to make a quip the words stick in his throat
You weren’t in the canyon he’d screamed and ever since he couldn’t forget the truth of his words
Epsilon hadn’t been in the canyon and Tucker isn’t sure he knows him at all
He shifts his gaze back to Carolina
So what
Should I just try to teach myself then
No
Carolina finishes her last spoonful of oatmeal before setting the spoon down carefully
I’m going to teach you
Tucker eyes her alarmed
As in you’re giving me one on one lessons
Well seeing as how no one else in this army insists on carrying a sword into battle
Okay but just to warn you I’m an annoying student like really annoying
Wash has filled me in on the type of student you are
I think I can handle it
Tucker glances between her and Epsilon resigned
Alright alright
So how we doing this
Carolina pushes herself away from the table
Come on
I’ll show you
She seals her helmet back over her head motioning at Tucker to follow her
Back to square one Tucker thinks dully
He scoops his dreads into his own helmet and falls in line behind her
They enter the training room which Tucker notes isn’t empty
Uh Carolina I think this one is taken he says catching her elbow and pulling her to a stop
She glances around
What
No it’s not
There’s plenty of space
But there are already people in here
They’re just lifting weights Tucker
The floor is clear
Yeah but But what
Tucker hesitates trying to make his voice sound offhand and casual when he says Wash and I are always alone when we work with the knives
How convenient Epsilon mutters sourly and Tucker swings to glare at him
Okay listen if you’re gonna
Don’t start Carolina says wearily
Tucker it’s fine
Come over here
She leads him over to the edge of the wide open space meant for in-armor sparring and picks up something sitting at the edge of the space
As they get closer Tucker can see there are two wooden swords and hefts the one in his hand as she passes it over to him
Weighs the same as mine he says in surprise
How did you do that
Sarge helped me make them she says and Tucker blinks
Man I thought all he knew how to do was crazy mechanical shit
You and me both she says with a laugh then straightens
Now
I haven’t used a sword like this before but I can show you a thing or two about footwork
I like the sound of that
Epsilon sighs loudly
That one doesn’t even make sense Tucker
Moving on Carolina says testily
She shoots Epsilon a look and Tucker waits as something passes between them
With a huff Epsilon winks away
Let’s start by seeing what you can do
Tucker glances subtly around the rest of the room but no one seems to be paying them all that much attention
None of the other sim troopers are here although Tucker does spot Ali Patil and several of the rebels milling about
He sighs and looks back at Carolina
So do I just try to attack you or
Let’s start with just seeing how you move
Show me a kata
A what
Youdon’t know what a kata is
Tucker rolls his head around in an exaggerated circle
Of course I know what a fucking kata is
What I don’t know is when you think I would’ve learned one for the sword that no one knows how to use
Alright alright Carolina says
Just relax
I am relaxed
I’m totally and completely relaxed
Carolina twirls the sword in her hand thoughtfully
I’ll just make a kata up for you to practice then
Tucker brightens
Okay great
You spend some time doing that and we’ll try this again later He trails off as Carolina starts inventing a kata on the spot twirling and slicing and stabbing and looking as if she’s spent her whole life with that wooden sword in her hand
Jesus fucking Christ
He’d always had a healthy respect for Carolina’s fighting prowess but Tucker suddenly can’t recall ever seeing her move quite like this without an opponent
Tucker had long thought katas were stupid what was the point in training without an opponent but watching Carolina he can visualize exactly what’s supposed to be happening
By the time she finishes five minutes later the rest of the training room isn’t even pretending not to stare
That was really pretty Tucker blurts when she turns to face him
He can’t see her face but the way her head jerks back infinitesimally telegraphs her surprise
It what
It was just Tucker shrugs
It was like you put on a one-woman play
That was cool
Can you show me that
She does
To his surprise Tucker finds himself falling into the movements easily
It feels comfortable instinctual even and when he expresses this sentiment to Carolina she shrugs easily
I’m not surprised
Oh really
Whatever happened to ‘Tucker you don’t know how to use that sword
’ You don’t she says in the sense that you’ve never had proper training but you’re clearly comfortable with the weapon
You move well with it in your hands
Come on do this kata with me
They run through the movements together side by side and although Tucker is pretty sure he doesn’t look half as cool as Carolina he still feels like a straight badass moving in unison with her
Good she says in approval once they’ve finished
Very good
I want you to run through that every morning
Focus on keeping your footwork nice and tight it’s where all of your movement stems from
Now let’s try to put some of it together
We gonna spar
Exactly
Carolina angles the sword across her body and gestures with her free hand
Try to attack me
Just as he starts to move Tucker catches a glimpse of Wash across the room sitting on one of the benches with his helmet down between his feet
Tucker hadn’t even noticed his arrival
His swing at Carolina goes wide and she sidesteps it easily whacking him on the back of the head with her own sword
Ouch
What the fuck
Carolina tilts her head at him exasperated
What the hell was that mess
Tucker tries and fails not to glance over at Wash again but Carolina tracks his gaze
Tucker focus
Use the movements we just went over
I am focused he grumps and comes at her again
It’s long hard work and if it were a real sword fight Tucker would’ve died about a billion times but at the end of the hour he has the sense of actually having accomplished something
Until recently he’d left his knife-training sessions feeling jittery and exhausted
He’s exhausted now too but it’s a different kind of exhaustion the kind that comes at the end of a job well done
No one is even paying him attention anymore
Wash had wrangled the watching Feds and News into an impromptu training session and is in full-blown lecture mode across the room
Carolina takes a seat on one of the benches and removes her helmet the short strands of her hair sticking to her forehead
She tosses a canteen at him and he joins her removing his helmet as well
Same time tomorrow
Tucker sighs
Yeah I guess
Thanks for showing me some stuff
She shrugs and they settle into a comfortable silence until Tucker catches her looking at him
So
You and Wash
Her expression is unreadable and Tucker sets his canteen down hard
Yeah me and Wash
Look if you’re going to start lecturing me and like threaten me with death and dismemberment if I hurt Wash or something
I
Carolina pauses exasperated
I wasn’t going to lecture you Tucker
Oh really
Then what were you going to do
I was going Carolina says calmly to ask if you knew what you were doing with that rope
Tucker doesn’t quite do a spit-take but it’s a near thing
He shoots a glance across the room but Wash and the other soldiers are distracted by something that Palomo just did
I what did you just say
You heard me Carolina says
There is a definite twinkle in her eyes that’s at odds with the serious tone of her voice and Tucker has no idea if she’s fucking with him or not
You yes I know what I’m doing with it
Got me some lessons on knots and shit
Hmm
From who
Donut
Carolina lifts an eyebrow
And does Donut know what he’s doing
He seemed to
Tucker rolls his eyes
Relax I’m being careful
You make him happy Carolina says abruptly glancing across the room
It’s nice to see that
Yeah Tucker says then looks at her a little more closely
Are uh
Are you happy
She stares at him
What
Tucker shrugs suddenly uncomfortable
Apparently he’s having heart to hearts with everyone today
Christ he’s turning into such a sap
I mean
You know since Freelancer fucked up everyone’s shit and now we’re all on this random ass planet andI don’t know just are you happy
Carolina leans her head back against the wall thinking
Sometimes she says finally
Sometimes I’mbetter
Better than I was
Tucker grins at her
Yeah
You got someone you’re using rope on
Instead of brushing him off like he was expecting Carolina’s mouth turns up in a smirk
Maybe
Wait really
Who
Come on you have to tell me
I think not Carolina says
I don’t need any betting pools going around about me
Let go of your dignity Carolina Tucker says with a grin
It’s much more fun that way
She winks at him then actually fucking winks
Subtlety can be fun too you know
Listen Tucker says suddenly
If you ever want to like grab a drink or something there’s a great bar not that far from here
We can exchange techniques and shit
I’ll keep that in mind Carolina says with a smile
The drinks part not thetechniques part
Good Tucker says then gives her a little nudge
We gotta stick together yeah
Team aqua and all that shit
Yeah Carolina says and after a pause she gives him a nudge right back
Tucker is waylaid outside the mess hall that night by Ali who approaches him and says without preamble You two are fucking ridiculous
Tucker stares at him
Huh
Okay so
Ali clicks through on his datapad and shoves it at Tucker
This is how Agent Washington stares at you
Tucker sighs loudly rolling his head up at the ceiling
Oh for Christ’s sake will you give it a rest with
Tucker trails off as he snatches the datapad and gets a good look at the drawing which as usual looks like it should be hanging in a fucking museum not scrawled on a datapad where hardly anyone will ever see it
It’s from this afternoon of Wash in the training room helmet off and resting on the ground between his feet
He’s leaning forward elbows propped up on his knees and head tilted slightly
And his face He doesn’t look at me like that Tucker says though his tone comes out more stunned than the dismissive lilt he was going for
Dude
Come on
Nobody looks at anybody like that
Ali snorts
Uh he was definitely staring at you like that the whole time you were waving that sword around earlier
Are you two seriously blind
Tucker opens his mouth to reply but falters as he stares at the drawing once more
Wash’s jaw is slightly clenched half of his mouth turned up in a smile eyes soft and reverent looking at Tucker like he’s brighter than the sun
Why do you like to draw us anyway
Tucker says sounding more flustered than he wants to
I mean like
What’s the appeal
Ali rolls his head exasperated
I don’t exclusively draw you two you are aware of that right
I just get the most requests for you guys
He takes his datapad back and starts swiping through the drawings
There’s Grif napping in the armory
Dr Grey on her tip-toes leaning up to kiss Sarge’s helmet
Caboose carrying two cadets off the battlefield
Carolina with her hand hovering just over Kimball’s shoulder
Patil crushing a watermelon between his hands
There’s the Feds the News the towering alien spires
These are amazing Tucker says when he can find his words again
You’re amazing
Dude seriously
You gotta like show these to people
Important people
Important art people
These are some iconic war images right here
Get that shit on the news or something
I justdraw what I see
Ali shrugs and taps his head
Gets it out of here ya know
He scrolls back to the image of Wash and sends it to Tucker with a few swipes
He fucking loves you man
Yeah yeah wait did you say you get requests
With a clap to Tucker’s shoulder Ali walks away whistling as he goes and leaving Tucker staring slightly dumbfounded at his retreating back
Giving himself a little shake he continues onward towards his room
He’s no sooner opening the door when none other than Wash materializes at his shoulder
Oh hey Tucker says motioning Wash into the room and pulling the door shut behind them
Where were you at dinner
Meeting Wash says distractedly popping the seals on his helmet and setting it on the floor
With Kimball
About the mission next week
Tucker takes his own helmet off as well
The big one
He looks at Wash’s face as he says it trying to catch a glimpse of that soft expression he’d seen in Ali’s drawing
Wash’s face doesn’t look very soft right now
On the contrary his eyes are dark and liquid and he’s looking at Tucker like
Wash practically lunges for him and Tucker finds himself pressed back against the wall with Wash’s hands fumbling at his armor
Tucker responds enthusiastically to the kiss his own hands immediately joining in to tear at the clasps of Wash’s own armor
Hello to you too he gasps into the kiss
Wash pulls back to look at him heaving both of their chest plates off and dumping them on the floor
You looked really good with that sword he says and he doesn’t even sound flirty or coy he sounds dead ass serious and Tucker’s dick jumps straight to attention at the words
Yeah
You liked watching me ohhhhhhhmygod Wash twists a hand in Tucker’s hair and tugs his head back his teeth dragging across the base of Tucker’s throat and Tucker stops talking in favor of making a whole host of other noises
He paws at their armor again but Wash catches his hand
I’ve got it he says voice low and wanting and Tucker watches through heavily-lidded eyes as Wash divests them of their armor in record time
He thumbs the release on the back of Wash’s Kevlar suit and starts tugging it off his shoulders exposing those glorious chiseled arms that have been the subject of so many of Tucker’s fantasies
He stops trying to yank Wash’s suit off in favor of running his hands all over Wash’s arms and chest fingers digging into the cuts of muscle in his shoulders his forearms his biceps
A noise of protests escapes him as Wash pulls away but it’s only to yank Tucker’s own suit off
Step out of it he says low in Tucker’s ear and Tucker immediately hops out of his suit kicking it off to the side
Wash yanks his own suit off and presses Tucker back into the wall
He grinds their hips together and Tucker groans at the contact
Where’s the lube
Jesus Wash Tucker gasps as Wash leans his head down and swirls his tongue around one of Tucker’s nipples
It’s it’s on my nightstand He blinks dazed as Wash breaks away
Stay there Wash says when he moves to follow
Tucker keeps his back pressed into the wall watching as Wash divests himself of his under clothing and paws around for the lube and condoms
He whips his own boxers off as well his face splitting into a grin as Wash returns pressing Tucker back into the wall with a kiss
Oh my God Tucker says giddy as Wash pops open the lube and squeezes some out onto his fingers
You’re gonna fuck me against the wall aren’t you
Wash pauses and looks at him the barest hint of uncertainty flickering in his eyes before he says
I might
If you ask nicely
Yes please Tucker says immediately because begging isn’t a big deal for him in the way that it is for Wash and how the fuck is he supposed to resist that voice anyway
Please fuck me against this wall
Please
Please Wash
What do you want me to do
Tell me and I’ll do it I swear
The rest of his words leave him as Wash wraps one hand around his dick and reaches the other around to Tucker’s ass one finger probing at his entrance and holy fuck Tucker doesn’t even know which way he wants to move his hips
Wash ducks his head his teeth fastening around Tucker’s earlobe and tugging gently
So gorgeous he mutters into Tucker’s ear and Tucker feels his whole face heat up at those words
Good God he’s actually fucking blushing
He’s had the dirtiest shit whispered into his ear during sex over the years and he hasn’t blushed once
But something about the way Wash breathes it into his ear his voice soft and gentle and like full of wonder it steals all the breath from Tucker’s lungs
You’re not so bad yourself he means to say but it comes out as hnngh instead and then Tucker just gives up on words and thinking because Wash adds another finger and he has the longest fingers in the world and Tucker doesn’t know what the fuck his other hand is doing to Tucker’s dick but it feels so good that it’s probably illegal
He tries to reciprocate in some way to get his own hand around Wash’s cock or kiss his neck or something but he can’t seem to stop shaking and his own hands aren’t listening
Wash has initiated sex before a bit hesitantly it was true but not like this
There’s a confidence and a heat to his movements that makes it hard to think hard to breathe
Wash he groans as Wash gets another finger in there and starts thrusting methodically
Holy fucking shit fuck me fuck me please I want you so fucking bad
Wash kisses him hard before pulling away and snatching up the condoms
Tucker wraps a fist around his own dick as Wash tears open the wrapper and starts jerking himself off he’s too wound up to wait but Wash catches his wrist and pins it to his own chest
Let me
Oh fuck me Tucker says as Wash rolls the condom onto his own cock with his free hand
Oh my God this is so hot like seriously it’s so hot
He gasps as Wash leans back into him scooping his arms under Tucker’s legs and lifting him straight up into the air
Tucker clutches hard at his shoulders and wraps his legs against Wash’s waist as Wash presses him tight to the wall
See I knew you had good arms for wall sex Tucker babbles still in that same giddy tone
He can feel Wash’s cock right against his ass and he squirms trying to urge Wash’s dick inside of him
Wash holds him fast nipping at Tucker’s neck
Wash he whines
He thrusts his own cock against Wash’s abs
Wash fuck me fuck me please fuck me please Wash shifts his hands on Tucker’s legs lines himself up and lowers Tucker down onto his cock inch by inch
He keeps going until his dick is fully buried in Tucker’s ass and stays there for a moment both of them panting into each other’s mouths before lifting Tucker back off of him again and back down again and
Tucker doesn’t have much leverage to thrust back at this angle so he just holds tight to Wash’s shoulders as Wash uses those glorious arms to lever Tucker up and down at the world’s slowest pace
Holy shit ho ly shit Wash what the fuck oh my god oh my god that’s good that’s so good I’m gonna die I’m gonna die it’s good it’s good it’s good Do you want more
Wash breathes into his ear and yep Tucker’s going to lose it he is absolutely one-hundred-percent going to melt into a puddle right here on the fucking floor
Yes please please more go harder go harder holy fuck
Wash easily readjusts his grip and thrusts up into Tucker so hard that Tucker very nearly screams
He wraps his fingers in Wash’s hair and fastens his legs even tighter around Wash’s hips and buries his face in the crook of Wash’s neck and moans and shakes and begs and falls to pieces right then and there
Wash slides one hand in between their bodies and cups Tucker’s dick against his stomach and touches his forehead to Tucker’s and it’s so intimate and at odds with the relentless way that Wash is pounding into him and Tucker comes hard between their bodies with a yell
Keep going he groans weakly after his orgasm peaks and he floats back down to Earth
Wash keep going keep fucking me I want you to come like this just like this
He does
Tucker can feel Wash’s whole body tense before releasing with a shudder
His hands tighten on Tucker’s hips the air leaving him in a gasp his hips slowing down minutely until they’re both pressed up against the wall breathing heavily Wash still hard inside of him
Wash pulls out slowly setting Tucker down his hands lingering until he’s sure that Tucker’s steady on his feet
Tucker stumbles over to his locker wipes off his chest with a towel and tosses it to Wash
He snags a fresh pillowcase wearily tugs it onto his pillow and flops down on his stomach with a groan
Oh my God
I’m dead
I’m never moving again
He feels the mattress dip as Wash sits next to him running both hands up and down Tucker’s back a few times
Tucker sighs happily as those magical hands move to his shoulders and circle there gently
So that was okay
Tucker rolls over onto his back looking at Wash incredulously
Dude
I’m pretty sure the entire army heard me fucking screaming
Where did that even come from
Wash grins laying down next to Tucker
There’s another one of those uncertain flickers in his eyes as he says I just thought you might like it if I Had your goddamn way with me against the wall
I totally did Tucker says enthusiastically
That was so hot
I can’t believe you just held me up there the whole time
That’s what happens when you train at your full potential Wash teases and then he touches Tucker’s face in that way he does all reverent and soft
I wanted to make you feel good
Mission accomplished Tucker says
You always make me feel good like holllllly shit
And don’t lie my sword training totally turned you on
And your sword training totally turned me on Wash allows
I like watching youmove
You like watching me move
Wash shrugs his face easy and relaxed
You move nice
You’re such a dork Tucker says leaning over to kiss him anyway
A major dork
They fall into a comfortable silence for a while Wash’s fingers trailing up and down Tucker’s arm before something occurs to Tucker
Oh
So tell me about you and Donut busting dramatically out of the Fed compound to come look for all of us
Wash looks at him
Donut told you about that
Obviously
Tucker gestures
So go on
I wanna hear the story
It wasn’t a dramatic breakout Wash says shiftily
Tucker rolls his eyes
Yeah I don’t believe that for a second
It wasn’t
We justsnuck out one night
Sarge covered for us for almost a full day before they realized what happened
Wash sighs
We didn’t even know where we were going butwe looked for Doc and for all of you andwell we found nothing
That was cool of you Tucker says
To try to find Doc
I should’ve offered that
I was trying to look for all of you Wash reminds him
Besides Doc’s my friend too
He was he forgave me when I didn’t deserve it
You all did
Wash stops suddenly his eyebrows furrowing
It’s not up to me to dictate other people’s forgiveness he says almost absently
Fucking preach Tucker says in approval and surprise
Who told you that
Wash blinks flushing
II’ve been talking to Dr Grey a bit
Yeah
Tucker props himself up on one elbow giving Wash’s shoulder a little push
Good for you man
Is it helping
Yes Wash says slowly
I thinkit might be
He looks up at Tucker blue eyes determined
I want to be
I want to get better
I think I might be able to
Maybe
Tucker feels his chest swell at those words at Wash’s open honesty at the way he’d just picked Tucker up and fucked him against the wall without once asking are you sure
He thinks he should say something to recognize the gravity of the moment but the words that flit across his mind are too high much too high
He scoops his words off the ground instead
You deserve it
Wash smiles at him and Tucker sees it then sees what Ali had sketched so carefully the tight jaw the soft eyes full of wonder and pride and
He tugs Tucker’s face down to his own their lips sliding together
They kiss and kiss and kiss mouths moving slow and soft long and languid like the sea at low tide before the waves come crashing in
Chapter End Notes can you believe we are officially halfway through this fic
I SURE CAN'T thank you to everyone who is along for the ride that is this story parts of this fic are going to get a bit intense sooner rather than later so just make sure you are reading the tags don't hesitate to reach out if you have questions about any of them and- trust me for just a little bit longer trust me
The small pained noise that wakes him seems louder than a gunshot
Wash hears the noise again followed by soft feather-light touches to his arms his stomach his hair
He snaps his eyes open to the feel of Tucker’s hands patting nervously up and down his body
Wash he whimpers dazedly in that same high-pitched voice
Wash you’re bleeding you’re bleeding
Adrenaline pumps through his system and Wash bolts upright in bed fumbling for the switch on the wall
Light floods his tiny room illuminating Tucker’s wide terrified eyes
His hands continue to fumble with Wash’s shirt and Wash yanks it over his head running his hands down his body as well
Why would he be bleeding
He’s fine he’s here with Tucker and he’s fine and besides there’s no pain he runs a palm over his implants half-expecting it to come away bloody but there’s nothing
Tucker’s breathing is ragged and Wash realizes belatedly that every inch of him is shaking
Understanding finally hits him and he catches Tucker’s wrists as Tucker runs his fingers over Wash’s stomach yet again
Tucker
You’re bleeding Tucker repeats
We have to have to get help
I’m out of biofoam and
Tucker
Wash lets go of one of Tucker’s wrists to catch hold of his chin and direct Tucker’s eyes to his own
It was just a dream
Tucker shakes his head
It
I saw you
Look at me
Wash slides his hand around to the back of Tucker’s head
I’m okay
See
No blood
Tucker looks at him then gaze sharpening eyebrows slanting down as he runs a hand over Wash’s chest
No blood
That’s right
We’re both okay
It was just a dream
Tucker sucks in a deep shuddering breath and Wash watches him closely for signs of an on-coming panic attack he’s good for that at least but Tucker only tugs his wrist back and scrubs his hands over his face
Fuck
Wash waits a few moments before asking Do you want to talk about it
Tucker laughs bitterly into his hands
What’s to talk about
I saw youI saw you He breaks off and Wash lets the silence sit busying himself with unscrewing the lid off one of Tucker’s canteens to give him a minute
When he nudges it at Tucker’s hand Tucker takes it chugging the water until he drains half the canteen
Fuck he says again wiping his mouth with the back of his hand
Jesus fuck
Wash takes the canteen away and reaches for him but Tucker puts a hand on his chest
Don’t go
He frowns catching Tucker’s hand
I’m not going anywhere Tucker
It wasn’t his intent but it gets an eye roll and a smile out of Tucker
That’s not what I meant you drama queen
I meant like you know Tucker shifts
Don’t go
When Wash continues to stare at him blankly Tucker sighs
On the mission Wash
Oh
Wash furrows his eyebrows
Is that what your nightmare was about
The mission
Nooooo
Tucker flops down onto the bed and drags a pillow over his face
Or yes
Maybe
I don’t fucking know
I just know you were bleeding out all over and I couldn’t stop it and it fucking sucked
Wash can certainly sympathize there
He’s had enough dreams of watching his friends bleed out to last him a lifetime
I know
He can understand Tucker’s nerves and Wash would be lying if he said he didn’t feel them himself stronger than usual
Only a few days ago Kimball and Doyle had filled them on just who this new band of enemy soldiers were that they were fighting former prisoners of the UNSC Tartarus
Former prisoners
Likelike murderers
Palomo had asked eyes huge and the panic had spread through the army like wildfire
Wash can’t really fault them for their distress
Mercenaries space pirates an umbrella corporation and now former prisoners
Who they were going to run into next was anyone’s guess at this point
Tucker whips the pillow away and sits up his brown eyes sharp and focused
Let’s both not go
What
Let’s just
Tucker hesitates before his words tumble out in a rush
Let’s just fucking leave okay
Can we like steal a Pelican and get off this planet before we both end up dead
Tucker
No I’m serious
Tucker pushes out of bed then yanking his headband off in agitation
Let’s leave
Right now
We’ll grab Caboose and get a plane and bust the fuck up out of here
Tucker Wash says again
He tries to snag Tucker’s arm but Tucker dances out of his reach
Look
We’ll get the Reds and Carolina too Tucker continues stubbornly
And Ali and the rest of the guys
And Dr Grey
Kimball too she needs a vacation
Andand the fucking teenage cadets andour Lieutenants Wash watches the emotions war on his face anger and stubbornness and finally a hard realization
Tucker stops his pacing to sit on the bed next to Wash staring dully at the floor
We have to finish this
Don’t we
With a sigh Wash turns his body so that it’s facing Tucker’s
He waits until Tucker catches his gaze and holds it before saying If you want to go we’ll go
Tucker clenches his jaw hard
Yeah
Yeah
Wash finds his hand and squeezes
But I don’t think you’d be able to live with yourself if we did
Tucker snorts
And you would
Wash hesitates but he can find no way to soften the answer
If we got out everyone we cared about then yes
Because you don’t give a damn about this planet Tucker says flatly
Really
Still
Because I don’t give a damn about this planet Wash echoes
But I do give a damn about an awful lot of the people on it
Our list of all the people we’d want to get out it’sit’s too big
We’d never accomplish it
We’d have to leave too many people behind people who wanted to stay behind
I don’t think either of us could live with that
Tucker nods face miserable and resigned but determined as well
So we finish this
We finish this
Wash sighs and this time when he pulls Tucker in he goes willingly burying his face in the crook of Wash’s neck
Promise me you won’t do anything stupid Tucker says his words slightly muffled
On the mission
Promise me
Stupid how
Stupid like self-sacrificial
I won’t do anything stupidly self-sacrificial
Tucker pulls away to glare at him
I mean it
Wash huffs
We’ve been on half a dozen missions since arriving here Tucker
Yeah but this is big
We’re going on the offensive against a bunch of fucking nutters here
If you collapse any rock tunnels I swear to fucking God Wash
I won’t Wash promises
I won’t
I’ll get us all out of there myself included
Okay
Tucker doesn’t answer but he flops back down against Wash’s chest
Wash hits the light switch and plunges them back into darkness lying awake until Tucker’s breathing evens out
I don’t like it
Kimball’s hands clench around the edge of her desk
You have made that very clear thank you General Doyle
Wash actively avoids looking at Carolina and can feel her avoiding his gaze as well as Doyle sputters
Miss Kimball we agreed months ago that at least one of our esteemed Freelancers must remain in the capital at all times
Sending both of them on a mission of this magnitude is not only risky but dare I say foolhardy as well
I’m sorry did you just say it was foolhardy
Kimball pushes away from her desk and folds her arms across her chest
This is war
We can’t just sit here and wait for Charon to come wipe us out
Can’t we
No we can’t Kimball snaps
We have to act
We’re strong
We have ammo we have medical supplies we have Agents Washington and Carolina who as you may have noticed have been instrumental in most of our victories lately
We know who these enemy soldiers are and we know where they’re going to be
They won’t expect a move like this
Oh yes you are quite right there Doyle says with a scoff
We know that we are sending our best soldiers up against a band of ruthless ex-prisoners
Ruthless ex-prisoners who are occupying one of our civilian cities
I am certainly not denying the importance of that it’s just really I should think it quite obvious that one of the Freelancers should stay behind to protect
To protect who
You
Doyle sputters
What of course not me
To protect the capital
To protect our home
To
Home home home
Doyle’s words fade into the background as Wash glances back out through one of the windows through to the landing bay where the soldiers are getting ready for the day’s mission
He can see the Reds and Blues there laughing bickering and shoving each other
Every single one of them is going on this operation
I don’t give a damn about the planet his own voice whispers and Wash clenches a fist hard at his side
I’m going he cuts in and both Kimball and Doyle falter
I’m going on this mission
Let me know when it’s time to leave
He sees Epsilon’s head jerk towards him sharply as Wash turns on his heel and exits half-expecting someone to stop him
No one does and he closes the door behind him with a bang
The chaos that meets him leeches some of the tension out of his spine
All of the soldiers going on the mission are clustered around the Pelican every one of them loud and boisterous
To mask their anxiety more likely than not
He’s seen it before has been there before
Tucker and Donut are on Grif’s and Sarge’s respective shoulders having what seems to be a chicken fight to the delight of half the army
Wash sighs leaning up against the wall next to Caboose
Who’s winning
I am Caboose says serenely and leaves it at that
Wash grins to himself watching the chaos unfold
He winces as Donut goes tumbling to the ground but bounces back up good naturedly seconds later
There are a lot of people going on this mission Caboose says suddenly
A loooot of people
Wash looks at him but Caboose says nothing more only continues to watch the ridiculous chicken fights taking place in front of them
That’s true Wash agrees finally
There are a lot of people
A lot of friends Caboose says his voice still cheerful and inconsequential but the words take Wash’s heart and squeeze it like a vice
It’llit’ll be okay buddy he says stumbling over the words awkward and clunky
Our friends they’ll be fine
Caboose looks at him
Promise
Wash can’t do it
He can’t look at Caboose at that helmet that he’d made him and lie
I can’t promise that he sighs
But I promise that we’ll try
To get out of there
To get everyone out
Okay Caboose says just like that as if it’s that simple and Wash can only stand there and pray that it is
They fall silent and seconds later Carolina is walking up to them
That was a dramatic exit she says wryly
Wash huffs
The amount of time those two spend arguing we could run twenty missions in the time it takes them to make a decision about oen
These aren’t easy decisions Wash
I know boss
He takes a deep breath and forces some of the tension out of his voice
So
Are you allowed to go or do you have to stay
I’m coming she says and Wash really does feel some of the tension leave him at that
The mission is too big
They need me
There is nothing smug about her tone only a simple statement of irrefutable fact
Wash sure as heck isn’t going to refute it
He nods as Tucker comes bounding over to him slightly out of breath
We getting this party started or what
That depends Epsilon says appearing in front of his face
You guys done screwing around
Or do you need to play a little bit more before we start
Tucker goes mysteriously deaf at Epsilon’s words turning instead to say something to Grif but before Wash can think too hard on it Kimball arrives and starts marshaling them all into various groups
Wash finds himself on the Pelican with Tucker Carolina Caboose and Sarge and half a dozen of Tucker and Caboose’s cadets
Epsilon flits around everyone’s heads running through mission plans as they all settle in
Now remember we have to approach them slowly in groups
If we go barreling in there all at once then they’re gonna
We get it Epsilon Tucker cuts in tersely after a solid five minutes of chatter and Epsilon sputters to a halt
Don’t know who the fuck you think put you in charge of this mission but okay
They glare at each other until Epsilon winks away reappearing over Carolina’s shoulder across the Pelican
Carolina throws a half-glance Tucker’s way but her attention is on the plans and maps sprawled out on the floor between her and Sarge
Tucker folds his arms across his chest and glares at the floor as if it’s personally wronged him
It takes Wash a few moments to realize just why the exchange left him so uneasy
Epsilon hadn’t snapped back he realizes
He’d actually shut up when Tucker had told him to which was completely at odds with everything Wash had come to know about the Reds and Blues
And Tucker
Tucker had called him Epsilon
Not Church
Epsilon
Wash frowns trying to remember if that had been going on for a while
He vaguely remembers Tucker referring to Epsilon as such immediately after the mission at the warehouse but that had been over a month ago Wash realizes with sudden alarm that he can’t remember the last time he saw Epsilon and Tucker actually interact
He glances across the Pelican to where Epsilon is kicking his foot dejectedly against one of Sarge’s maps his back to Tucker who is still in full-blown sulk mode
Wash opens a private radio channel with Tucker and ventures a cautious Um
Tucker’s gaze locks onto his own
What
How long hasthat been going on
Tucker stares at him until Wash gestures at Epsilon
What about Epsilon
That
Right there
Wash drops his voice
Tucker
Why are you calling him Epsilon
Because that’s who he is Tucker says suddenly fierce
That’s his fucking name isn’t it
It is Wash says slowly
But Are you going somewhere with this
Tucker snaps
Because we have way more important shit to be worrying about at the moment
Is this Wash hesitates
Is this
 because of the warehouse
Because of what I told you
About Freelancer
No Tucker says
He fidgets
Well okay fine that’s part of it
What’s the other part
The other part is that he’s not fucking Church Tucker hisses
He jerks his visor towards Epsilon and glares some more
He’s not he’s not Alpha and he’s pretending to be and it’s fucked
It’s so fucked up
But you knew that Wash says surprised
You knew they were different
Yeah but Tucker scuffs his foot against the deck of the Pelican and shrugs
I don’t know I guess I didn’t really get it
Not until the warehouse
Wash waits unsure of how far to push but Tucker continues in a burst
He just ever since he found out I
 ya knowhad a thing for you he kept fucking lecturing me
Even after that damn warehouse when you were all fucked up he thought I was gonna take advantage like oh the shit you used to pull in the canyon Tucker
And I was like dude
How the fuck would you even know
You weren’t there
You weren’t with us in the canyon
You’re not Alpha because Alpha’s gone
Wash looks at Epsilon biting his lip and hesitating before saying You know that’s my fault right
Tucker throws a glance his way
What’s your fault
That Alpha is gone
Tucker freezes in his movements turning to face him fully this time
Yeah
I know that
Then you know it’s me you should be angry with
I’m sorry didn’t we already have this conversation like a million years ago
Tucker says annoyed
I know what you did Wash
I’m only saying Wash says carefully that it’s not Epsilon’s fault he isn’t Alpha
Then he shouldn’t be pretending Tucker says angrily
He shouldn’t be pretending like he is
That’s not entirely his fault either Wash says
I can’t believe
Tucker forces his voice back down to a whisper despite the fact that no one else can hear them
I cannot believe that you’re defending him
I’m not defending him Wash says calmly
I’m just what was done to him was cruel and it’s not a shock that he sometimes forgets willingly or no what’s real and what’s not
Do you forgive him
What
Tucker gestures at the back of his head
For what he did to you
Do you forgive him
Wash sets his jaw
I no
I don’t
Tucker snorts
Okay then
Maybe don’t fucking lecture me about it
I’m not lecturing you Wash snaps
I’m just look
I’m just saying maybe you two could talk about this or
Ugh
Tucker throws up his hands
I’m so fucking sick of talking about shit
Besides he doesn’t want to talk to me
He’s so fucking jealous he can’t stand to even look at me
Wash frowns
Jealous
Of what
Of Tucker gestures vaguely in between Wash and himself
You know
No Wash says blankly I don’t
Tucker sighs loudly
Of us
Of uson this mission
Oh my God Tucker groans smacking his head back against the wall
Noooo
Of us
Of you and me
Of thisthing between us
Thing
Of our relationship Tucker emphasizes
Of the fucking
The flirting
The cuddling and shit
He’s jealous
Wash laughs startled
What
Why on Earth would he be jealous of us
Tucker gives him an exasperated look that Wash can detect even through his visor
Dude
Seriously
When Wash doesn’t answer Tucker sighs leaning forward to prop his elbows on his knees
Wash
He loved you
Wash laughs again dimly aware that it sounds a bit more unhinged this time
What he didn’t we weren’t it wasn’t like that he was my AI we were partners
I don’t mean like that
Not love in the way that I
I mean not in like the way that people some people love other people that they’re dating and
Tucker sits back in his seat visibly flustered
Wash stares at him
I mean didn’t you two have some sort of like mind meld going on
Wasn’t that the whole point
Wellwhen you have a smart AI implant into you even a fragmentit’sof course it’s intimate Wash frowns flustered
He’s been in Carolina’s head as well
And yours
Are you saying that means he loves you guys too
Yes Tucker says immediately
That’s exactly what I’m saying
But it was different with you
" He was my AI for less than a week Wash says unsure of why he feels quite so panicky
He hates me Tucker
He doesn’t Tucker says quietly
You guys justwent through some shit together
He look
You trust me right
Yes Wash says immediately
You know that
Do you trust him
No
He can barely even say the words
Not anymore
That’s my point Tucker says
He looks over to Epsilon who is chatting away in Caboose’s palm
The point is he fucked it up and he knows he fucked it up and he knows he can’t fix it
You can fix it though Wash says determined to direct the conversation back to its original point
You two
You canhe cares about you Tucker
About all of you
You were thethe first friends he ever had
We weren’t Tucker says still in that same unnervingly quiet voice
You were
They both finally fall silent for good after that
BANG BANG BANG Wash drops and rolls pressing his back hard against the retaining wall as he comes back up in a crouch listening hard
Everyone good he sounds out over his team’s frequency
The various affirmative replies ease his tension and he smiles to himself because things are going well
Their Pelicans were grounded two miles out in a jungled ravine and the hike had amazingly been void of all whining
They’d crossed ground to surround the occupied southern quadrant of Lanic City where the captured civilians had first sent alerts to Kimball and Doyle about the enemy presence and the origins of mismatched fighters
From where he is crouched Wash can see the blurry outline of the prison airship docked far beyond the boundaries of the city
The news had been troubling; press ganged convict soldiers would doubtless be a difficult enemy
But they’ve been on the ground in active combat pushing an hour and Wash has come to the conclusion that unless these soldiers are being intentionally disorganized and inattentive they’re simply not that good
He thinks now that some of the hysterical panic that had gripped the army as of late was a bit too generous
A lot of white collar criminals he muses to himself dispatching a scrawny soldier who managed to trip from out of a doorway
Felix and Locus were clearly not concerned with training their soldiers
There is little to no comradery between them either
Even as he watches one of the former prisoners shoves another on top of a well-timed grenade launched by Donut and takes off into the trees
Wash’s chest swells with pride as from across the courtyard he’s currently taking cover in he sees Prajapati take out the fleeing soldier back pressed tight to Patil’s in a way they’ve never accomplished in training
He sees Simmons signaling that the block is clear and his team moves forward
They’re retreating Wash marvels watching the pirates break rank and fall back towards their various Pelicans
They’re actually retreating some of them even running
He opens his team’s radio keeping his rifle carefully up as he scans the immediate area
Boss are you seeing this
Sure am
Carolina’s voice comes only the slightest bit out of breath
Wash catches a glimpse of aqua armor across the battlefield that he instantly identifies as Carolina twirling her way across the field
Washington move your squad forward
I’ll take out a few more of these idiots and circle up with you
On it
Wash snaps his radio off and turns opening his HUD to pinpoint the location of his squad
They’re all nearby their heat signatures pulsing reassuringly
He double-checks Caboose and Tucker’s location and starts out towards them
He should get to them first before advancing
He should
KA-BLAM
Pain punches hard through his left thigh jerking a yell out of his throat and dropping him to his other knee
He whirls rifle up scrambling to put his back to something and retreats to the retaining wall he’d been leaning against
High above him in the windows of one of the tallest buildings he catches the gleam of metal in the sun the glint of a sniper rifle and of armor grey and green
Wash swings his rifle up and empties half his clip at the window sending Locus ducking out of sight for a moment before another bullet explodes in the wall inches from Wash’s head
Something bright and red dances across his eyesight and Wash looks down to see the red dot of a tracker leveled at his chest
Wash steals a glance at his thigh
The bullet had punched straight through his armor and he can feel the blood leaking freely down his leg
It would pierce his chest plate no problem
He keeps his own gun up gaze locked onto the window
He can’t see Locus can only see the glint of the sniper rifle pointed at his heart but he can feel Locus’s eyes boring into his own
Silence
Wash’s breathing is heavy and ragged in his ears and he can feel the blood pooling underneath his leg
He reaches slowly for his canister of biofoam and no sooner has it in his hands that the KA-BLAM of the rifle sounds again and the canister spins away exploding against the wall behind him
Another shot comes seconds after the first striking his battle rifle and missing his hand by centimeters
Wash manages to hold onto the gun but the message couldn’t have been clearer
DROP IT
Gritting his teeth Wash carefully lowers the gun to the ground and raises his hands
As the red dot reappears on his chest once more a voice sounds loud and agitated and not far at all from his position
Jesus Christ I am at the southwest quadrant and I still don’t see him
At the house with the green door yes you did say green door
Look just upload his position to my fucking HUD and I’ll find him
Felix
This is bad
The red dot holds steady over his chest but another shot doesn’t come
He’s alive
Locus could’ve shot him ten times over by now but he didn’t and Felix is on his way to his position which means they want him to stay alive
Which most certainly does not mean anything good
His thoughts swirl in his head the pain and blood loss making everything slow and sluggish
There’s nothing for it
He’s not getting out of this alone
He needs help
He needs
Using his helmet’s voice prompting feature Wash takes a deep breath and opens the radio up to his team’s frequency
Agent Washington reporting in he says doing his best to keep his voice level
I’ve been shot in the leg and I’m pinned down by a sniper on the southwestern quadrant of the field
Tucker responds first uttering an impressive string of curses before snapping Jesus Christ
I knew this was too easy alright hang on dude
We copy Wash Carolina says her voice steady if a little thin
Tucker Caboose you’re the closest
Can you get to his position
Epsilon sputters voice coming through higher than normal
C we need to get over there too
Already on it Tucker says
I’ve got it Epsilon
Wash presses his head back against the wall trying not to focus on just how red the ground underneath him looks
Tucker he says his voice slurring slightly on the last syllable
I didn’t do the stupid heroic thing see
I called you guys
Very funny Tucker says his voice sharp
Glad you’re choosing now to start cracking jokes
Wash moves a hand slowly towards his thigh he needs to put pressure on this wound but another bullet pings so close to his hand that it actually stings a little
Fuck
Um Tucker that was an awfully loud boom Caboose says nervously
Yeah I know Caboose
Wash what the fuck was that are you
I’m fine
Warning shot
Wash sucks in a breath around the pain
Tucker
Caboose be careful
The sniper is on the twentieth floor of the brown building and And Felix is here
God what a mess
He doesn’t realize he’s said it out loud until Tucker’s voice comes again urgently
Wash what’s a mess
Wash closes his eyes forces himself to stop rambling and focus
He must be losing more blood than he thought
The sniper is Locus
His hesitation is only momentary
Felix is here too
Close by
Tucker curses under his breath
Of course
Okay hang on Wash we’re coming to you
Wash glances out from around the corner of the building
He can see Felix stalking around about fifty away
He’s engaged in a firefight with several of the Federalist soldiers so Wash thinks they have some time but not much
Be careful
Wash hesitates before adding
Locus could have killed me but he didn’t
They all hear the unspoken meaning behind his words and when Carolina says Tucker I’m coming over there to help he doesn’t utter a word of protest
Fucking finally Epsilon says
Let’s put some pep in our goddamn step here people
Wash nods before remembering that they can’t see him but the effort that it takes to form words is almost impossible at that point
They’re coming
His team is coming and everything inside of him is at war torn between wanting to just let them and wanting to keep them all far far away
They shouldn’t get hurt trying to save him
They’ll kill him if he doesn’t let them
Wash peers out from behind the wall again forcing the words out
Guys be careful don’t do anything too risky
He never finishes his sentence
There’s a blur of orange and grey in his peripheral and suddenly Wash is turning snagging the pistol from his hip and firing it as soon as he has a visual
He ignores the pain in his bad leg and swallows down a yelp raising himself up slightly but his assailant is too close for him to reload and the gun goes spiraling out of his hands
Felix aims a kick at his chest that has Wash hitting the ground hard on his back and when that foot follows him down he thinks fast
He grabs his knife from its holster and buries it in Felix’s calf
Felix howls bending down to pull the knife out and toss it aside where it sinks with a thunk into a nearby fence post
Oh you asshole Felix breathes and then he lifts his foot up and stomps it down hard above the bullet wound in Wash’s thigh
Wash’s vision goes grey at the edges and bright red in the center as he lets out a short agonized scream
His HUD is flashing at him warning him of blood loss and imminent unconsciousness and Tucker and Caboose and Epsilon are frantic in his ear but there’s no time for any of that because Felix drops his knee hard into Wash’s solar plexus and grits out You know I’ve had just about enough of you
The breath leaves Wash in a whoosh but he still struggles as Felix pops the seals on his helmet
The pain in his leg and loss of breath leave Wash unable to do anything more than paw Felix’s hands and Felix gets it off of his head in no time
He wraps one hand around Wash’s throat armored fingers digging onto his exposed flesh and uses his other hand to amplify the radio
Tucker’s voice is suddenly loud and angry between them
Wash I swear to God look just stay right there don’t move
Oh don’t worry Felix says suddenly
Agent Washington isn’t going anywhere
I’ll make sure of that
There’s a moment of silence before Caboose mutters Well that’s just not very nice of you
Oh this is just too rich
Captain Tucker
You know I so hoped you would be the one to answer
And we have the big blue idiot listening in as an added bonus
Felix’s grip tightens around his throat and Wash claws at his fingers as his vision starts to darken
I’m almost tempted to make the both of you listen to me kill him right now
Carolina is silent listening hard but Wash can hear her quiet exhale over the radio
He thinks suddenly of Rockslide of listening to her breathe on the other end of the radio for the first time in years soft and slow and steady
Epsilon is apparently unable to keep silent any longer and his voice is ugly full of anger
Listen up you sick son of a bitch
Seven Wash croaks and Felix glances down at him
There’s seven of them around us still a sniper be careful
Felix tightens his grip squeezing hard enough now to cut off Wash’s words
You just shut the fuck up down there he snaps
Wash Tucker says sounding remarkably calm far calmer than Wash would’ve expected of him
Just hang tight we’re on our way
Hey Tucker Felix says brightly
Remember when you were freaking out because you thought Wash here was being tortured by the enemy for all those weeks
There’s a beat in which Felix stands grinding his foot purposely onto Wash’s thigh once more
Wash lets out a strangled cry at the pain thrashing away but Felix presses down harder still until Wash’s vision starts to double and his cry edges towards a scream
Well Felix says smugly holding Wash’s helmet high
I just want to make sure that you know that this time
It’s gonna be true
The last thing Wash hears is Tucker and Epsilon screaming over the radio before Felix rips the whole thing out of his helmet
The radio cuts out with a high-pitched whine of feedback that sends Tucker clawing at his helmet cringing at the sound
He turns the volume down low on his own radio then turns to fumble with Caboose’s until the feedback runs itself out and there is only silence and breath
Tucker focuses on that
Caboose’s loud open-mouth breathing Carolina’s soft little exhales Epsilon’s rhythmic static
There is nothing from Wash
Wash breathes like the sea steady and soothing but Tucker cannot hear the sound of the tide rolling in and out in and out in and
Wash
Carolina speaks first her voice small and scared and unlike anything Tucker has ever heard from her
It sends an icy chill straight down Tucker’s spine Wash’s name falling from her mouth not the firm Agent Washington report that Tucker was expecting but an uncertain question to which they all know the answer
They’ve got him Epsilon says voicing it anyway
His radio is destroyed
Tucker
Caboose
Tucker doesn’t realize he’s been clutching Caboose’s forearm until he feels it wrenched away from him as Caboose takes off at full speed
You can really see how fucking big Caboose is when he runs Tucker thinks blankly
He forgets it himself sometimes the extent of Caboose’s power and strength but seeing him charge across the battlefield as if someone’s life depended on it
Which it does of course
Wash’s life depends on it
Wash’s life depends on their speed and their strength and their wits and Tucker is standing here like an idiot while motherfucking Caboose is all over that rescue mission shit
Color and sound return to Tucker with a bang blinding and overwhelming in their intensity and he stumbles forward tangles himself up in his own feet and falls on a shaky knee
Frozen in fear that was the expression and Tucker had never understood it because he acted without thinking as Wash was so fond of saying
Tucker was always moving always doing always charging forward barreling into collapsing rock tunnels and the blades of knives when his friends were in danger but now but now he can’t move he can’t breathe his limbs have frozen into ice and Tucker realizes that he has never in all his life been this terrified
Not Again
The words drop into the center of his skull stones into a frozen wishing well and Tucker watches their fault lines fracture across the ice
Freckles shake
Not again
The ice shatters and Tucker breaks free charging after the blue blur that is Caboose both of them running like they’ve never run in their lives
He watches Caboose skid to a halt fifty yards ahead of him a spray of bullets striking the ground and Tucker casts his eyes around until they land on one of the useless ex-prisoners hiding in a doorway and doing his best to waylay Caboose
Tucker puts a bullet through the center of his visor before the fucker can actually learn to use that gun
Ten seconds later one of the space pirates appears out of fucking nowhere and launches himself at Caboose who is already charging full speed ahead once more
Caboose shakes him off as if he weighs nothing and the pirate goes flying headfirst into a brick wall landing limply with his head twisted at a sickening angle
Jesus Christ
Caboose be careful he yells over the radio as Caboose cuts heedlessly through another spray of bullets
You’re gonna get yourself shot and then I’m gonna have to save both of your asses
Caboose doesn’t even answer him the fucker no stupid comments or cheerful wisecracks
Tucker forces his legs to move faster still because he’s only heard Caboose go dead quiet like that after very bad things had happened like that time when Caboose had hauled Wash off of him after that terrible nightmare at Rockslide or after Epsilon had screamed at them in the holo-projection chamber or after he’d got the news that one of his sisters had died or
Tucker is accosted himself then by another one of the space pirates who comes at him from the side with two pistols drawn in true asshole fashion
The motion barely catches the edge of Tucker’s peripheral and he turns hard crouching low and firing up until the pirate drops the pistols falling limply from his hands
He notes belatedly that the radio channel they’d linked up for everyone on the mission to share is pinging incessantly
He switches over just in time to hear Sarge saying Carolina I’ve cleared your way go
Tucker straightens out of his crouch as a blur of aqua zoom by
Carolina the whir of her speed mods a familiar and welcome sound
She catches up to Caboose and then surpasses him rounding a corner that Caboose soon turns as well
Tucker covers them both dispatching pirates and ex-cons alike until he finally rounds the corner to the coordinates where Wash’s position had last been triangulated
Blood
There is so much blood soaked into the dirt
It can’t all be Wash’s
It can’t because if he’d lost that much blood he’d be unconscious or
Tucker flails in a frantic circle searching for Wash or the rest of his team
Twenty yards up and to his left he can see Carolina engaged in a furious fight with Felix all fists and tackles and flashing knives their guns forgotten on the ground
Caboose is exchanging impatient fire with several more pirates and several more of their own soldiers have joined the fray
Prajapati and Patil Fitz and Martinez
Everyone is engaged leaving Tucker free to continue his desperate searching until
There
Yellow and steel green and grey
Tucker’s eyes land on Locus several city blocks ahead as the merc makes his way towards a Pelican drop ship and there slung over his shoulder is Wash
He’s limp and boneless and his helmet is off and before Tucker can think on if it’s a smart idea or not he screams WASH so loud that Locus turns to look at him
Not again
Tucker runs
He runs taking off at a dead sprint ducking and weaving and sprinting in between the pairs of fighters
Locus watches his progress dispassionately for a few seconds before turning and continuing towards the Pelican the breeze that blows sudden and swift through the buildings ruffling Wash’s hair and Tucker can see it now just barely the blood staining all that blond
Wash Wash Wash he chants under his breath as he runs and he’s getting there he’s closing in until some fucking pirate comes flying out of the shadows and lunges towards him with the world’s biggest knife
NO
Tucker yells and he turns to meet the pirate using his gun to block the knife and twist it away just like Wash had taught him just like they’d practiced
He grabs the falling knife flips it in his hand at twelve feet you throw it by the blade it’s all about depth perception you can do it I know you can come try it again and hurls it at another approaching enemy soldier where it sinks through the center of his visor before turning back to asshole number one and putting several bullets into his head
Tucker go I’ll cover you
Ali’s voice sounds in his ear
Tucker can’t see him didn’t even know he was close by but he doesn’t question it
He simply runs vision tunneling in towards where Wash and Locus are but he isn’t getting there fast enough the Pelican’s ramp is descending and he isn’t getting there fast enough
NO
The word tears out of him again so loud it burns his throat as the door closes just before his scrabbling hands
He activates his sword and plunges it into the side of the Pelican but before he can start slicing his way in a bullet grazes his forearm and he jerks back with a yelp his sword dropping into the dirt next to him as he falls
The blood and the pain are dim unimportant things and Tucker pushes up to his feet but it’s too late the Pelican is lifting off
There’s a flash of bright blue and suddenly Caboose is there taking a flying leap through the air and launching himself at the Pelican
He catches onto the bottom as it lifts off and swings until he is standing on the side
Caboose
The name catches in his throat and Tucker clenches a hand around his sword eyes fixed on his teammate high above him
Caboose inches his away along the edge of the Pelican until he reaches the panel where Tucker’s sword had pierced the hull draws his arm back and puts his fist through the opening
Tucker realizes he’s muttering under his breath an incoherent stream of holyfuckingshit jesus fuck jesus christ as Caboose widens the tear in the hull with nothing but his hands
There’s a brief moment where Tucker thinks it might actually work that Caboose can fight his way inside and take out these fuckers and bring Wash back-- But then Caboose is jerking to the side and flattening himself against the edge of the Pelican as a stream of bullets sprays out of the side and Tucker hisses sharply as he watches Caboose put a hand to his ribs and curl in on himself
The Pelican is rising faster still and it’s high it’s much too high and Caboose is hurt and he can see Felix now his torso sticking out through the hole in the Pelican
He reaches for Caboose fastening a hand around his chestplate and Tucker’s heart stops because that’s his team up there that’s his fucking team and he is about to lose them both
Felix doesn’t yank Caboose into the Pelican as he was expecting just shoves him back hard until his feet leave the side of the ship
Tucker’s heart swells in something like pride as Caboose latches hard onto Felix’s arm and almost yanks him straight out with him
Felix wrenches free at the last moment and the ship is speeding away and Caboose
Caboose falls
He falls so very fast from so very high and Tucker feels a scream bubbling up through his throat
It never makes it out just ends in a funny little gurgle as Carolina activates her speed mods again and jumps so hard that she leaves a miniature crater in the ground
She catches Caboose in her outstretched arms and the two of them tumble hard to the ground with an awful THUD
Tucker runs to them but Carolina is already on her feet and Caboose is pushing himself to a sit
Tucker grabs Carolina’s elbow and squeezes as she stumbles a little on her feet
So badass is all he can manage and once he is sure she’s steady he drops to his knees next to Caboose even as he frantically scans the skies for sight of the departing Pelican
Caboose
Jesus Christ
He puts a hand over the bloody gash in Caboose’s side but it appears that the bullet only grazed him
Caboose shakes his head and pushes Tucker away gesturing wordlessly
Tucker turns bewildered but he sees only their friends still engaged in combat and one of their own Pelicans resting on the ground
Oh
Oh
He claps a hand on Caboose’s shoulder and spins snagging Fitz as he charges by
Fitz cover them
I’m going after Wash
Before Fitz can say anything Tucker is off sprinting towards their Pelican
Tucker what are you doing he hears Simmons cry as he passes him but Tucker doesn’t answer
He has to go the ship that has Wash’s is only a tiny blip in the distance and he has to go now
Grif’s voice comes incredulous over the radio
Tucker you can’t be serious you can’t take that plane all by yourself
Fucking come with me then
Tucker snaps
He’s already halfway up the ramp
We have to hurry they’re getting away
They’re already gone
They’re not
Tucker glances wildly at the horizon and after some searching he finds it the little black dot that is the departing ship
They’re right there we have to go after them now
And do what
Simmons now
We don’t have a plan we can’t take them
We can take them Carolina says her voice hard
We can take them
Tucker I’m coming to you
It’s broken
They all fall silent as Caboose’s voice cuts in through their chatter so quiet they almost missed it
Caboose what’s broken
Tucker asks urgently
He’s in the cockpit now flipping switches and opening hatches and realizes belatedly that nothing is lighting up nothing is humming to life nothing
Our bird
The bad guys broke her
Movement catches Tucker’s eye out of the Pelican’s windshield and he sees Caboose standing up a handful of broken wires from the belly of the Pelican cradled in his bloody hands
They’re cooked Epsilon says twenty minutes later
He paces back and forth in front of Carolina arms folded so tightly across his chest it looks as if he’s hugging himself
All of them
All of our Pelicans
They’re destroyed
We can’t even get ourselves out of this city let alone go after His avatar glitches flashing purplebluepurpleblue
There’s a long moment of silence during which everyone looks at each other
The space pirates and ex-cons are long gone dead at their feet or retreated far into the city and the air is eerily silent without the booms from the guns and grenades
But we have to Tucker says into the silence
We have to we’re going to lose him we
We’ve already lost him Grif says
He’s on his second cigarette voice indifferent and uncaring and Tucker knows how Grif gets in a crisis knows that this is Grif’s own way of dealing with things but it doesn’t stop him from smacking the cigarette right out of his hands
No fuck that
Tucker turns away spinning and searching the skies once more for the tiny Pelican that he already knows to be long gone
Fuck that
They wouldn’t be gone if someone would just help me if we leave now we can go after them and No one answers him
Tucker spins again to Epsilon
Can’t youcan’t you track the Pelican or
It doesn’t matter if he can track the fucking Pelican
Simmons snaps
What are we going to do run after them on foot
If we have to
Tucker says angrily
He glances around at them at dull listless faces and blank helmets before settling on Caboose
He’s sitting on the ground by Carolina’s feet the gash in his side patched up with a smear of biofoam the wires from the Pelican still clutched in his hands
I’m going Tucker says
You can all come or you can fuck off but I’m going
Tucker turns picks a direction at random and starts marching
He doesn’t make it five seconds before a hand fastens around his forearm and wrenches him back
Grif his face drawn and hard
Uh I don’t think so ‘cause then we’re gonna have to rescue two assholes from Blue Team and I do not have the energy to babysit Caboose during that time
Grif
Tucker jerks his arm but Grif’s grip holds fast
If you think this is funny
Sit down son Sarge snaps
Tucker turns in time to see him snatch up Grif’s fallen cigarette stick it in his own mouth and inhale deeply
Man’s got to know when he’s lost and we’ve lost this one
Nothing for it but to plan Operation
Free Frecklelancer
Yeah which starts right now
Tucker wrenches his arm again but Grif doesn’t let go
Alright look Grif says
It’s been a long day I’m tired and Donut ate all the ration bars
I told you I’m a stress eater before the mission even started so I haven’t eaten in three hours
A real tragedy that Simmons mutters
Grif ignores him
So I really really really don’t want to have to knock you out and drag you on the Pelican when it gets here but I’ll do it because you’re not mounting a one-man rescue mission with no plan and no rations
Sit
Down
Tucker finally pulls his arm out of Grif’s grasp and Grif lets him
He doesn’t sit down but he doesn’t take off running either
Everyone’s looking at him
Everyone
He has to pull it together
He is a Captain
He has a duty to this planet
I don’t give a damn about the planet
Wash’s voice echoes in his head and Tucker wants to laugh at the irony of it all
It should have been someone else he thinks and then immediately hates himself for the thought
This isn’t fair he says instead his voice petulant and childish even to his own ears but no one contradicts him
No one says a single word
It is late by the time the Pelicans arrive and take them back to base
Tucker is torn between wanting to go straight to Kimball and demand resources for a rescue mission and to go with Caboose to the infirmary
His world has contracted into circles from Chorus to the armies to the sim troopers and Carolina to Blue Team
It’s just him and Caboose now and the thought of leaving Caboose’s side his stupid obnoxious side is unthinkable
Go Carolina says when she sees Tucker hesitate on the landing bay
I’ll debrief the Generals
Sarge and I will start putting a plan together
Go with Caboose
He nods
Thanks he says too late as Carolina is already halfway across the bay
Tucker turns to where Caboose is sitting glumly on the ramp of the Pelican
Let’s go
You look like shit
He does
None of them had even realized he’d hit his head in the fall until Epsilon growing suspicious had bullied him into taking his helmet off on the Pelican
Tucker had finally taken the goddamn thing off himself after Caboose had staunchly ignored them all to reveal half of Caboose’s curls matted with blood
Caboose ignores him still and Tucker sighs loudly slinging Caboose’s arm over his shoulder and pulling him to his feet
Come on you big baby
I know you can fucking walk on your own Jesus Christ
He keeps Caboose’s arm there anyway the entire way to the infirmary
He waits clutching his helmet and trying not to tap his foot impatiently while Dr Grey talks Caboose out of his armor and examines his injuries
The bullet had indeed just grazed Caboose’s side Dr Grey confirms and the wound isn’t cause enough for any real concern
It’s his head that worries me just a teensy bit she says
How far did you say he fell from
Tucker blows out a breath thinking
Had to be forty feet
It’s very lucky that Agent Carolina was able to break his fall oh I’m sure it’s nothing to worry about Dr Grey says catching sight of Tucker’s drawn and worried face
Just want to keep him overnight so that I can peek in on him if need be
Tucker glances at Caboose expecting him to protest he hates hospitals but he says nothing
He hasn’t said a word since he’d discovered the damage to the Pelican and that was hours ago
Okay Tucker says instead
I’ll stay with him for a minute
Make sure he doesn’t do anything stupid
Are you going to do anything stupid
Tucker looks up at her sharply but she doesn’t look stern or disapproving just miserable
Wash was her friend too he reminds himself
I might he says
But not tonight
We we don’t even know where he is
Tucker turns the break in his voice into a cough
He can’t look at Dr Grey as she puts a hand on his shoulder but he reaches back to clutch her fingers so tiny in his own
We’ll get him back silly she says
He nods as her hand slips away listening to the sound of her quiet footsteps crossing the room and the snap of the door closing behind her
It’s just him and Caboose then the beeping of the monitors the only sound in the silence
Tucker sighs drags a chair next to Caboose’s bedside and drops down into it
This is so fucked up he says more to fill the silence than because he expects any sort of response and sure enough Caboose doesn’t answer
Tucker gives it up just sits there and starts braiding his dreads back out of his face while Caboose stares listlessly at the ceiling
Wash should be there with them
Wash should be there fretting over Caboose’s stupid head wound and hounding Dr Grey and asking if she was sure if she was really sure that he was going to be okay because that’s what Wash did
He took care of them looked out for them and now he needed them and they couldn’t even
Um Tucker
Tucker pauses in the act of securing his hair back with a thick band and looks at Caboose who is staring at him with a solemn look on his face
Yeah
Are they going to hurt Wash
Tucker closes his eyes and sets his jaw
He can’t look at Caboose
He can’t
Yeah
They’re uh he ties off his hair and lets his hands fall clenching them hard in his lap
"They’re gonna hurt Wash
Are they going to torture him
He turns sharply to look at Caboose then
How do you what does who told you that
I know what torture is Tucker
Tucker shuts his mouth so fast he can actually hear the teeth click
Caboose won’t meet his eye just fidgets with a loose string in his blanket
It’s um
It’s like hurting people but worse
Simmons says that the bad guys will torture him for information but ah
Yeah
I don’t think Felix wants information
He’s going to kill Simmons
What do you think he wants
I think he just likes to make people hurt Caboose says
It’s not very nice
Jesus Christ Tucker says for lack of anything else to say anything at all Yeah Caboose says
Yeah
We’ll get him back Tucker says
I fucking swear to God Caboose
We’ll get him back and then he can yell at us for not cleaning our armor or some shit fuck I don’t know
Yeah Caboose says again
Tucker leans his elbows on the side of Caboose’s bed and buries his face in his hands
When Caboose pats his head it’s rough and awkward but Tucker doesn’t shrug him off
He’s too tired
He’s much too tired
Sleep does not find him that night
The thought of going to sleep in his own bed is laughable
He can’t go there to his room that smells like Wash and probably still has Wash’s hair all over Tucker’s clean pillowcases
He can’t go to Wash’s room either with the perfectly made bed that faced the window
Tucker had never asked why Wash went out of his way to yank the bed around so the window was at his feet
He thought there was time
He thought they’d have so much time
Don’t think like that he tells himself firmly but it’s too late
The thoughts are there burrowing black into his brain and he cannot shake them off
Tucker stays next to Caboose’s bedside for so long that he ends up just piling his armor on the floor and crawling into the empty bed across the aisle from Caboose
The infirmary bed is tiny tinier than the one in his own room but it feels miles wide with its emptiness
He and Wash didn’t spend every night together but they spent enough always close always tangled up
You’re so warm Wash would mumble at him at some point almost every night
Tucker had thought at first that he was complaining about having an actual furnace in his bed until he realized that Wash liked it because Wash was always cold
Always
It could be eighty fucking degrees in the mess hall and he’d have a sweatshirt on
There’s a draft he’d insist whenever Tucker would bring this up
It’s chilly
" So Tucker would pile every fucking blanket on top of them at night even if the temperature really only called for one and he’d flop on top of Wash and they’d drift off bundled up and warm
Wash slept better that way with the warmth and the weight
He wonders if Wash is cold right now and once his brain latches onto this thought he can’t let it go
Tucker wonders if Wash is in a cell somewhere without a bed or a blanket
If the cell is drafty or wet of if they’ve purposely dropped the temperature
If he’s trying to get some rest or trying to stave off sleep
If he still has his Kevlar suit or if he’s only in the thin sweatpants and t-shirt underneath them
If his cell has a window or if it’s dark
So very very dark
There is no sound for snow falling
There is only the quiet and the blood rush in his ears and the way the flakes melt like tears down the slope of his visor
He lets his palms fall and the snowflakes wink into stars before turning black
They leave him lying there
He senses this before he even opens his eyes to see not the brightly colored shades of reds and blues bending over him but the cold steel armor of the UNSC
Oh thank God one of the soldiers breathes weakly as Washington stirs in the snow
He’s alive
The Chairman wanted to question this one personally
Looks like you get to keep your job after all one of the other says clapping his comrade on the back
He puts a hand to the side of his helmet
General Logan reporting in Washington’s vision starts to go grey around the edges again and his hearing flickers in and out like a badly tuned radio as the soldier drones on and on into his radio touched down on Sidewinderno sign of the simulation troopers
Agent Washington into custody The soldier falters as Washington starts to laugh
The motion pulls painfully at his ribs and he should stop but really what does it matter
It’s funny he slurs up at the soldier in between giggles and it is
It’s so funny
It’s a goddamn hilarity is what it is that after all of it after Alpha after Epsilon that his own journey isn’t going to end here bleeding out in the snow that after everything he’s done to avoid going back to prison he’s going back to prison
His laughter stops abruptly as someone finally plunges some biofoam into one of his many wounds in his torso that’s bleeding all over the snow
The snow is red and the sky above him is so very blue and he can’t bear to look at either of these colors so he closes his eyes and lets the blackness take him
He does not see the sun again for three years
The Chairman it turns out is not all that interested in questioning him personally
Once it becomes clear that the Epsilon unit is broken and that Washington has no idea how to open it it’s game over
I believe that you have lived out your usefulness Agent Washington says the Chairman and he flicks a dismissive hand at the guards waiting by the door
Take him away
There’s a brief moment where Washington considers trying to fight them but they lock his armor down before the thought can really take root
They take him away to a place where he can’t cause any trouble to a prison transport ship drifting through space
They call it the UNSC Tartarus
Time is a funny thing
Washington blames it on the ceaseless yawning black between the stars but it seems to him that he blinks and three years have gone by
They pass in a blur minutes blending into days into weeks into months
They are sluggish and slow and when he finds himself standing at the door of his cell hands clenched around the bars it is as if he’s woken up from a dream
The air crackles with a new intensity that his world was lacking all these long years and he clenches his hands tighter around the bars and listens hard
There are intruders on the ship pirates or mercenaries possibly both
It doesn’t matter
So many of the words that they are saying do not matter kill lots of people for lots of money we don’t care who you are men who can follow orders hold their own
They don’t matter
Only one thing registers
Freedom
So if you’re willing to fight for your freedom one of the mercenaries says dramatically firmly grasp the bars of your cell in a show of solidarity
Washington can hear the murmurs of the prisoners around him who the fuck are these guys can’t tell me what to do this is bullshit so fucked up who cares sign me up and none of that matters either
His hands are wrapped around the bars before the mercenary has even finished speaking
A good thing too as the airlock opens with a howl and he feels everything in him wrenched towards the endless space behind
Wash looks back despite himself at the stars opening their arms to him at the makeshift window at his feet
It feels strange to be looking at them from this angle
--sometimes I think I joined up just to see stars like this
--the metal screeches on the floor as he drags his bed around to face the
Washington’s visions swims as his feet hit the floor hard the airlock doors closing with a CLICK
JESUS CHRIST the prisoner in the cell next to him howls before vomiting all over the floor from the sounds of it
Congratulations the other mercenary says
You’re hired
Washington straightens shaking out his forearms and peering through the bars
The two mercenaries were going cell by cell from the looks of it
Nothing for it but to wait until they reach his
He remains there at his door forcing himself to wait to be patient to not pace the confines of his cell as he’s done so many times before
It seems to take forever for them to get there
The soldier in green and grey does a double take when he reaches Washington’s cell glancing repeatedly between Wash and the datapad in his hand
Agent Washington he sounds out slowly
Of Project Freelancer
Former Agent of Project Freelancer Washington corrects wryly gesturing around his cell
As you can see I’m no longer in their employment
The mercenary seems to grow even more intrigued
His comrade on the other hand could visibly not care less
A Freelancer
Fascinating
Jesus aren’t you guys supposed to be dead
We are
They are
I’m the only one left
The second mercenary snorts
Uh hate to break it to you freckles but it just so happens that on this very ship
I know about the Counselor Washington interrupts
His eyes flick up and to the left to where he knows the Counselor’s cell to be before he can stop the motion but he can tell they both saw it
You harbor ill feelings towards the Counselor the mercenary in green asks watching him closely
Washington does not try to hide the bitterness in his laugh
Yeah
You could say that
What about Agent Carolina
Wash lifts an eyebrow
Are you going to try and tell me that she’s on the ship too
No we’re going to tell you that she’s leading the band of morons that are royally fucking up our plans
The second mercenary this time
Something has changed in his demeanor a razor sharp focus on Washington where before there was a casual indifference
You might want to recheck your facts Washington says
Agent Carolina is dead
The merc sighs loudly pulling up his own datapad and swiping through it
Then who pray tell is this
He shoves the datapad at Wash who takes it with a frown
A news article is pulled up on it titled COLORFUL SPACE MARINES STOP CORRUPTION
Beneath it is a photograph of Chairman Malcom Hargrove himself surrounded by red and blue soldiers that look oddly familiar
The simulation troopers he says in surprise
The first mercenary leans in closer
You know them
Yeah Wash says slowly
Yeah I know them He’s far far more interested in the soldier in the aqua armor shaking hands with the Chairman
He knows that armor has fought beside it a million times but
That’s not her he says shoving the datapad back hard at Felix
That’s not that can’t be her
Agent Carolina is dead
I can assure you Agent Washington she is not dead
How the hell would you know
The Counselor has assured us that this soldier is indeed Agent Carolina the first mercenary says
He has analyzed the footage we have of her fighting style
That combined with her armor enhancements and the Epsilon AI powering her suit
The what
The words come far louder than he intended and Washington realizes he’s gripping the bars of his cell so tightly that his knuckles are white
I’m sorry he says more calmly
He has to play this right or he’s never getting out of this goddamned cell
I thought you said the Epsilon AI
That I did the mercenary says slowly
Does that upset you
Oh my God the second mercenary moans
What is this a therapy session
Look
The bottom line is the Freelancer and her little sim trooper friends are turning into real thorns in our sides
We need people to take them out
You in or what Agent Washington
You can drop the Agent Washington snaps
It’s just Washington now
You two got names
I’m Felix the second mercenary says
He jabs a thumb at his comrade
And that’s Locus
And you my friendare hired
His first bit of real human contact in three years is violent and comes in the form of a messy football tackle arms wrapping around his waist and driving him hard into the ground
Washington has been in the prison ship’s mess hall for less than two minutes listening to Felix prattle on in some twisted version of a motivational speech when one of the other prisoners breaks out of line and launches himself at Wash
They’ve passed each other a thousand times
Washington is fairly certain he asked this very soldier to hand him the salt shaker at lunch two days ago but he has apparently been waiting for the opportune moment to
To try to kill me Washington notes with a clinical detachment as the soldier climbs on top of him draws his fist back and slams it across Washington’s face so hard that he tastes blood
What the fucking fuck he hears Felix exclaim but then the soldier hits him again and okay that hurt that really fucking hurt
Washington catches the third punch twists and puts pressure until he hears a POP
The soldier howls and Wash uses the opportunity to shove him away and climb to his own feet
That was my last clean shirt he says smoothing a hand pointlessly over the blood at his collar
A quick glance around the room shows that hardly anyone except for Felix and Locus are paying them the slightest bit of attention anymore
Don’t you know who I am the soldier breathes
He’s clambered to his feet but he’s cradling his wrist and looking as if he’s torn between fury and hurt feelings
Should I
Perhaps not comes a voice from behind him smooth as silk and Washington feels his skin crawl and bunch until he’s drawing his shoulders up nearly to his ears
He turns to see the Counselor breaking away from the ranks as well to glance between Washington and the soldier who is apparently his unknown arch-nemesis
You have met before but have never seen each other’s faces
You know me though Washington says directly to the soldier
He looks at him a bit more closely the short cropped hair the tattoos the scarred face
There’s nothing about him that suggests this man is familiar
I know everything about you Freelancer the man spits
I know about all of you
Your call signs
Your armor
Even your faces
You took everything from me my life my team
Can we wrap this tragic backstory bit up
Felix snaps
I’m sure you’ve been rehearsing this for a long time but we’re on a bit of a timetable here pal
Washington tries to control the way his fingers twitch when the Counselor speaks again
Agent Washington it’s possible that you may not remember this particular mission but during your time in Freelancer you were part of a mission to recover what we called the sarcophagus from Ch
Charon Industries
I remember
Washington says shortly
I remember
And it’s just Washington now
You can drop the Agent
Of course the Counselor says
This man here is
I don’t need you to speak for me the soldier snaps and Washington feels something in him roar in approval at the man’s words
He turns to Washington
You can call me Sharkface
Felix snorts
Really
That’s what you’re going with
You killed my family Sharkface spits
They’re dead because of you
It sounds that way
You how can you
Look if it makes you feel any better I got what was coming to me
My f my team is all dead too
Washington smiles at him a wry bitter twist of his lips
Oh and
Bonus points for the two years I spent in a psych ward and the three I spent on this prison ship
Something shifts in Sharkface’s expression something rather pleased but before Washington can interpret it the Counselor is speaking again
Agent Washington
It’s Washington
If I may your team is not entirely dead
Agent Carolina is in fact alive and well and fighting with the very people you are about to oppose
So I’ve heard Washington says tersely
The Counselor tilts his head in a frown
Youdo not believe this to be true
Washington snorts
I’ll believe it when I see it
I know Carolina
--Triazaolm you react badly to Triazalom
--you were cute as a blonde but I think red is your true color
II know her
He gives his head a hard shake
If she’s alive I’ll know it when I see it
She’s alive
He knows it the second he sees her move in person a blur of grace and deadly speed her body twisting and arcing through a butterfly kick across the battlefield from him
Pay the fuck attention
Sharkface hollers over the comms as Washington hesitates a moment too long and a bullet whizzes past his visor
Washington winces as the feedback pitches and gives his helmet a firm pat
His armor sucks
It’s his own goddamn fault for taking so long to choose it he’d reached instinctively for the first grey armor he’d seen in the salvaged pile that Felix and Locus had dumped in front of them but found himself hesitating inexplicably over the aqua armor
Carolina he’d told himself uncertainly
He had Carolina on the brain was all
There was no reason he should want aqua armor he didn’t even like the stupid color
-aqua and steel and yellow mixed together on the floor
--it’s not teal Jesus Christ Grif how many times do I have to tell you it’s aqua
In the end Wash had chosen grey armor with aqua accents
It was a ridiculous decision but no one questioned him on it
No one gave a fuck what armor he wore or what he did at all really
All he had to do was fight and kill
He could do that
It didn’t matter
Carolina doesn’t matter either and neither do the sim troopers fanned out around her
Wash ducks into an alcove and reloads his rifle trying and failing not to watch them
They move like magnets he realizes
Magnets tied together with little bits of red rope and steel
They fan out and regroup flit away and come back always sensing when each other was in danger saving each other’s lives time and time again half by accident and half by deadly precision
The cavalry
He thinks of the Warthog smashing through the wall and the Pelican dropping into the snow and  and whiskey and birthday cake and if you want to apologize just do it and what does it look like I’m doing I’m giving you a massage and you’re not broken and you do deserve to be played with
Something shudders in his head hard and Wash presses himself deeper into the alcove to suck in an uneven breath
He needs to get a grip
You need to get a grip Freelancer
Felix yells in his ear and Wash grits his teeth and charges into the fray
He’s shaken shaken from his musings on Carolina and the sim troopers
It isn’t until much later after they’ve lost the battle and a good chunk of the men fighting with them after the blood and the gunfire when Felix is pacing and yelling that Wash names the feeling he’d felt when watching the Reds and Blues move together
Nostalgia
Nostalgia and jealously
Jealousy sure he can see that
Nostalgia
Impossible because nostalgia implied that he’d had it and he’d never had anything like that not in Basic not before the military not even in Freelancer
--oh come on Wash I’m pretty sure we can trust youI mean we are friends
What did you just say
Wash blinks to see the counselor looming large in his vision
Huh
Friends the Counselor says slowly
You saidfriends
No I didn’t
" Perhaps says the Counselor Agent Washington should sit out the next mission
He does appear to be a bit overworked
Agreed Locus says shortly sweeping passed him
Agent Washington take the day off
How dare he Washington thinks dispassionately watching out of the corner of his eye as the Counselor moves away
Not nearly far enough
Washington gets his chance shortly after the next mission when it’s just him and Sharkface in a room with Locus and Felix
The four of them have somehow become the leaders of the pirates without anyone really discussing it
The Counselor walks into the room and stands next to Washington opens his mouth and suddenly Washington realizes just how comfortable the man is standing next to him as if he doesn’t even realize what he did
It would be easy too easy to take his knife and draw it across his throat
Washington takes a moment to envision the moment in minute detail the blood the glazed eyes the gurgling
It would be so easy and still he hesitates
The moment should be bigger it should be so much bigger for what he did
--Wash it sounds to me as if you were psychologically abused
The easiest thing that he could do becomes the easiest thing that he’s done as Wash draws his knife steps in swiftly and draws it across the Counselor’s throat without a word
They all fall silent as the Counselor hits his knees and then the ground before going still forever
Feel better
Felix snarks after a long moment of silence during which they all watch the Counselor’s blood pool around him
Washington leans down wiping the blade off carefully on the Counselor’s shirt
The muscles in his face feel funny and he does not hide the smile that bursts out as he stands
It’s the truest smile he’s felt in years
Yeah he says slowly
Yeah
I really really fucking do
Word of the Counselor’s death spreads quickly though no one seems to care beyond giving Washington an even wider berth
They thought he was crazy
There was a time when Washington would’ve fought against this label would’ve tried his best to present himself as reasonable and sane but now he pulls it around himself like a cloak
Let them think he’s crazy unhinged inches away from snapping and killing them all
It isn’t far from the truth
So what’s your deal
Are you gonna snap and kill us all
Washington turns away from the mission plans he was musing over to see Felix leaning against the doorframe
What
I mean not that I really care that you offed the Counselor but Felix shrugs
He was giving us some pretty useful information on Agent Carolina that we now aren’t getting
Don’t worry about that
What do you want to know
About what
About Agent Carolina Washington emphasizes
He sincerely hopes Felix can hear the eye roll in his voice
We worked on the same team for years
I worked with the sim troopers for a bit too
You already know all of this
Oh well you’ll forgive us for not taking tactical advice from the most unhinged man on this goddamned ship
Let me engage them
Washington turns to face Felix fully folding his arms across his chest
On the next mission
I understand the way they fight together and I think I can use it two blurs of aqua new and what’s left of the old
Tucker’s back is pressed to his own and they spin together like points on a compass
See that
Felix straightens pointing an accusing finger at him
What is that about
Washington realizes too late that he’s half bent over the nearby console one hand pressed to the side of his helmet
He straightens hastily
It’s nothing
Headaches
Whatever Felix says
Look if you can’t keep it together
I can
Washington forces his voice to sound casual
Just just let me engage them
Alright
He holds his breath while Felix glares at him unsure of why this seems so vitally important
It doesn’t matter who kills the sim troopers as long as someone kills the sim troopers it doesn’t have to be him he has nothing to say to them nothing at all
He has even less to say to Carolina
It doesn’t matter
It doesn’t matter
It doesn’t
Fine Felix says
Fine
Jesus Christ
Kill all the sim troopers or maybe just some of them
I don’t care
Just don’t fuck this up alright
I won’t Washington says heart racing in his chest
I won’t
He fucks it up the second he comes face to face with Carolina
It isn’t seeing her move again up close that gets him although the feeling is gut-wrenching and exhilarating and devastating all at once
It’s the way that Washington hesitates and she doesn’t because she doesn’t recognize him
They almost slam right into each other when rounding the same corner
Washington is half a second too late in getting his battle rifle back up to bear
Carolina isn’t
Her gun is back up in his face finger on the trigger and all he can think to do is blurt Carolina
There is the slightest waiver in her gun arm a moment of uncertainty but she does not lower the gun and half a second later there’s a blue shimmer by her shoulder before a little AI holo-projection winks into life looks at him and says Wash
You Washington says blankly
Felix and Locus were right
They were right
This is Carolina and this is Epsilon which means
He laughs
It starts as a snicker and turns into a howl and once he starts he can’t stop
He laughs so hard that he drops his rifle and bends over to clutch at his abdomen
I’m sorry
I’m sorry he gasps waving a hand at Carolina who has half lowered her guns in favor of staring at him
Sorry it’s just you you went and got him the Archives didn’t you
You went and got him all of you and and
His voice breaks into laughter again and he clutches at the rock wall next to him for support
Oh man he gets out between giggles
Ohhhhh man
I love it I love it
Wash she says slowly and takes the smallest of steps towards him before another voice breaks in
Uhhhwhat the fuck
Wash half turns to see the Red sim troopers behind him red and maroon and yellow and pink the pink one who definitely should not be there because Wash killed him
I shot you he says conversationally
You should be dead
And then he starts laughing again because why wouldn’t the pink one be alive why wouldn’t they all team up to bust Epsilon out why wouldn’t they all be standing here with Carolina like they were the best of friends
Sorry sorry Wash gasps again
He fumbles with the seals on his helmet and drops into the ground wiping at his eyes with the back of his wrist
Sorry it’s just it’s funny
Yeeeeeah you’ve said that the orange one
Grif Wash remembers says slowly
He glances at Carolina
Honestly I think we should kill him just to put him out of his misery
Well maybe we should get on that the maroon one hisses before he comes to his senses and murders us all
I don’t think he’s going to come to his senses anytime soon Simmons
I mean look at him
--are we intruding on some sort of lover’s quarrel that’s a hell of a way to ask someone for a threesome Agent Washington is that a holographic lock we are going to talk about our feelings
Washington’s vision actually blacks out this time and he rests his head against the cool rock until it subsides
That keeps happening he explains to Carolina and the sim troopers
That keeps keeps happening
What keeps happening
Simmons asks nervously we've got a certain way of doing things around here and that way includes baking birthday cakes out of ration bars and taking the time to spray paint the killer Freelancer's shoulder pads yellow
That Wash says pointing helpfully at his head
That
I think I’m going crazy
Son you ain’t kidding the red one grunts
Colonel or General or something ridiculous
Sarge that was it
You’ve gone loonier than a bowl of fruit loops
He glances over at Carolina who still hasn’t said a word
It wouldn’t even be fun to kill him when he’s like this
The RATTATTAT of heavy machine gun fire cuts off Sarge’s words and they all scatter
By the time Wash looks up dazed they’re gone and Locus is inches from his helmet
Focus Agent Washington
It’s just Wash he says then blinks
I mean
I meant
Washington not
But Locus is already gone leaving Wash scrambling for his rifle and his helmet steel with the aqua stripe painted down the center
He stares at it for a second too long before jamming on his head to hear Felix in the middle of a full blown freak-out said you could handle it what the fucking fuck was that bullshit
You had them
You had them right there and you
Wash mutes the radio with a racing heart stumbling out from behind the rock wall where he’s been posted up
He almost runs into someone again one of the blue simulation troopers this time one whose name he doesn’t have to struggle to remember
Caboose he says in surprise
Agent Washington
Caboose yells positively delighted
He points at Wash’s shoulder pads
You are blue now instead of yellow
Does that mean you would like to join Blue Team after all
I uh
Caboose move away from him
Something tightens in Wash’s chest as he turns to see the other Blue sim trooper behind him rifle pointing at Wash
Wash keeps his own rifle up as well as the trooper begins to circle slowly
Hey asshole he snaps
Drop your fucking gun before I blow your brains out
Wash doesn’t drop his gun
He keeps it trained on the sim trooper as he keeps circling until he’s placed himself between Wash and Caboose
Tucker he says after a moment of straining to remember
Yeah congratu wait how do you know my name
Wash frowns a little
I
--She raises her gun to Tucker and there is no decision to make at all
There are only the memories lined up in their neat little boxes inside his head
Don’tdo that
Washwhat are you doing
Protecting my friends
Now lower the weapon don’t know he gasps
I don’t know I don’t know I
Tucker I don’t think Washington is feeling very well Caboose whispers loudly from over Tucker’s shoulder
Good
Tucker readjusts his grip on his rifle
He’s gonna be feeling even worse in about two seconds when I put a bullet through his
--It’s the first real hug he’s had in years and he should pull away but he can’t and the three of them stand there in a messy embrace--   "This is for science
"What
" "It's called oxytocin
The chemical your brain releases
Oxytocin
" "I think you're saying it wrong
"I'm not saying it wrong Caboose
" Washington stumbles forward his vision doubling and Tucker shoves his gun in Washington’s face
Don’t take another fucking step
There’s a flash of lightning and a boom of thunder so loud that Wash thinks for a moment Tucker has shot him
Something arcs in the air between them and falls softly at their feet
They all glance down as the rain begins to fall at the small black
GRENADE
Tucker yells and they all dive out of the way
Washington flattens himself to the ground arms wrapped around his head as the explosion rattles the ground and blows a hole in the wall of the nearest building
Washington rolls out of the drive rifle up to aim at Tucker
The rain falls heavy down his visor now and Washington tosses his head in annoyance
Windshield wipers that’s what these helmets need he thinks absently as his finger starts to tighten on the trigger
He’s always hated the rain
--He reaches for the bar of soap that Jackson left sitting on the ledge and scrubs every inch of his body
The water pulls his memories to the surface and he thinks
I did
I did like to swim
Me
His mind settles and he thinks of nothing except the water
Of nothing except the rain
Of nothing except the drain running clean
No
Wash lowers his rifle putting a hand up
Tuckerwait wait
Tucker is so surprised at the absurdity of his action that he actually does stop
What the fucking
--I like the rain though
I know I like the rain
-- The rifle falls from his hands with a soft thump
This isn’t right he says and then louder
This isn’t right
Tucker is staring at him a bewildered tilt to his helmet but he isn’t shooting
He isn’t shooting
Dude
--Dude
Go play
Wash jumps and turns to look at Tucker flustered
What
Oh
I just we should go
No no really
There’s something about the way Tucker is holding himself it’s so still as if the very air around them is made up of the thinnest glass
You just
You look like you want to feel the rain is all
You you like the rain right
Go on it hasn’t rained in forever
I’ll hold your helmet
This isn’t it isn’t real it isn’t Washington takes his helmet off once more letting it fall next to his rifle
He inhales deep breathing in the rain and it’s so familiar and soothing that it takes him a few heartbeats to realize that he can’t actually smell it
He can’t even feel it on his face
--I didn’t do the stupid heroic thing see
I called you guys--   Wash surges forward towards Tucker and Caboose but even as he reaches for them they disappear between his hands like smoke misting up in the rain
UhLocus
What
I think he’s waking up
What
That’s impossible
You said it was impossible once we passed the
Wash whirls around in circles trying to catch where the voices are coming from they sound as if they are right in his ear but he is alone utterly alone on this rainy battlefield this battlefield that isn’t real
He cannot smell the rain and it isn’t real
Wash closes his eyes and brings the world crashing down around him
The adrenaline from one world carries over into the next and Wash’s eyes snap open his body jolting to a sit
He doesn’t quite make it to a full sit
There’s a sharp lancing pain in his chest and suddenly he is choking gagging on something blocking his airway
Wash clutches at his chest and neck as some dim part of his brain catalogues his surroundings hospital no restraints green and grey and orange bright lights hospital hospital hospital
There’s an IV in his arm and he still can’t breathe
Wash claws frantically at his face and finds at last the cause of his troubled breathing
There’s something over his mouth and down his throat something big and plastic and
There are unarmored hands grasping at his wrists and Wash turns his attention to that instead
He rips the IV out of his arm pulls the offender close and stabs the needle into the side of his neck
His mind is starting to go loopy and dizzy from lack of oxygen and he fastens his hands around the plastic over his mouth and pulls hard
A breathing tube he realizes as he’s yanking it out
A violated sort of horror swoops through him and he barely registers the burning ache in his throat and his chest as he hurls the breathing tube away tumbles out of his hospital bed and vomits all over the floor and himself
There’s a pinch in his abdomen and everything feels wet his face and his mouth and his thighs and none of it makes sense because there was no rain it wasn’t real it wasn’t real
PUT YOUR BACK TO A WALL some dim memory screams at him
Carolina’s voice or Maine’s or maybe even his own
Wash doesn’t question it just scrambles until he can press his back to a wall and get a sense of his surroundings of the exits and the enemies around him
He’s no sooner found a wall and pressed his shaking shoulders to it when there’s an armored hand wrapping around his throat lifting him clear off the ground and slamming him back into the wall
Wash fights against the hold thrashing hard but his muscles are weak and slow from lying in a hospital bed for
How long
Wash thinks dizzily as Felix’s face fills his vision
How long
I don’t want to say I told you so but Felix casts a glance over his shoulder and Wash can see Locus there hovering in the background with his arms folded over his chest
Well
I did tell you so
Unfortunate Locus growls sounding Wash notes hysterically more than a little pissed off about it
He turns his attention to the man whom Wash just sent crashing to the ground
You assured us that once Agent Washington had been kept under for a week or more the odds of him waking up were
Slim the medic gasps massaging the side of his neck where Wash had stabbed the IV
I said they were slim you crazy fucker not impossible
I told you people I wasn’t a fucking brain surgeon
Told you so Felix sings again
I did tell them so he says to Wash dropping his voice conspiratorially
Wash pulls hard at Felix’s hand around his throat but his grip does not give
What what He can’t get out any more than that
His throat is positively aching from Felix’s hand and the feeding tube and over a week without using his voice
Right now it feels as if he’ll never be able to talk again
Felix seems to understand though
Oh what did we do to you
He shrugs carelessly
Crossed a wire here crossed a wire there fucked around with some of those alternate reality meds we found in a closet and boom we almost had you
Locus here was really hoping we could get you around to our side butoh well you win some you lose some am I right
No matter
Wash freezes momentarily as someone new speaks their voice smooth as silk a voice that he would know anywhere but it was impossible impossible impossible
He cranes his neck to see but the speaker is in a corner of the room where Wash’s eyes don’t reach
He’s fading now fading fast struggling to keep his eyes open and keep Felix’s helmeted face focused in his eyes
This was only phase one of the process the voice continues
Remember gentleman
We are constructing something of awin-win situation for ourselves here
Even if Agent Washington’s friends did manage to rescue him it will only be to our benefit
Felix tilts his head at Wash critically
Seems like an awful lot of work for one fucking soldier
Think of it asremoving the crucial piece from a tower of blocks
Like Jenga the medic mumbles from the floor
You know that game where you build a tower of blocks and
I know what Jenga is Felix snaps
Jesus Christ if I have to listen to one more metaphor from any of you I might actually kill myself
Precisely like Jenga
The voice pauses
We have removed one of the blocks from their Jenga tower and even if they were to steal it back from usthey would soon find that it no longer fit in its place in the tower
" The voice burrows its way into his skull between every crack and crevice in his brain dragging memories out of their boxes and to the forefront of his mind--  --so you would say you have overwhelming feelings of anger and a need for revenge
It can’t be him Wash thinks
It can’t be he can’t be here I killed him I killed him myself Did you
Another part of his mind whispers
Did you really
Wait wait wait
Wash squeezes his eyes shut and slams his thoughts to a halt blocking out the voices swimming around him
He tries to gather up the memories to scoop them away into their neat little boxes but there are more now there are too many and he can’t do this again he’s running out of boxes he’s running out of colors
He tries to stave off the panic but it sets in anyway crawling into his brain and scattering the memories to the wind once more
Wash opens his eyes to see all of them looking at him and he realizes he must have said at least part of that out loud
Locus makes an aggravated noise somewhere where Wash can’t see
He’s barely coherent
Because he’s fucking losing it
That’s a good thing remember
Felix turns back to Wash and pats the side of his face with one hand the other tightening around his throat
Forget giving them back a Jenga block right Wash
If they get anything back at all it’ll be a pile of matchsticks
The speaker clears his throat
Felix if you wouldn’t mind
Felix sighs gesturing a hand out behind him
Someone get me a fucking sedative
No Wash mumbles stirring once more
No
The medic slaps a syringe into Felix’s open palm
Wash struggles even as Felix brings the needle up to Wash’s neck and holds it there
It’ll be a real delight he whispers to see you burn your precious sim troopers to the ground since all you want is to keep them so very safe
I’m gonna relish this fallout
Wash feels a hard pinch before his body goes slack and his thoughts grow sluggish and then he feels nothing nothing at all day one
This is how he awakens the sun blood red across his eyes and Wash sighing in his sleep on Tucker’s right
It’s how he’s woken for so many mornings now that Tucker’s squinting against the sun before he realizes that it isn’t there because the angle is all wrong
He’s reaching for Wash too slowly quietly so as not to wake him
Wash thinks that he’s the one who wakes first every morning
Wash is wrong but Tucker would never admit it in a thousand years
The few times that Wash does catch Tucker awake first he frowns and squints at the clock and tells Tucker that he should’ve woken up him ages ago that it was getting late and Tucker would roll his eyes and say Jesus Christ it’s barely oh six hundred and Wash would huff and say still we have to get going and Tucker would watch him get dressed or pull him back down for quickie and Wash would follow
What Tucker doesn’t say is that short of someone setting the base on fire he wouldn’t wake Wash out of a deep dreamless sleep in a million years
What he doesn’t say is that he really really likes how Wash’s arms tighten around him whenever Tucker shifts slightly
What he doesn’t say is that when he looks at Wash like that sleeping in the morning light he feels
He feels
Tucker’s arm falls across an empty mattress and his eyes shoot open
This is wrong
He’s cold and his back is stiff and the light in the room is coming from the wrong angle and he’s still in his Kevlar suit and Wash isn’t here
Wash he mutters
Tucker jolts to his feet so fast that the blood rushes to his head
He places a steadying hand back on the mattress and lets the black ground him uses it to think
Tucker
Tucker blinks the stars from his eyes and swings around to look at Caboose who is sitting up in bed and rubbing at a thick bandage wrapped around his forehead
Hospital
They’re in a hospital
Caboose continues to stare at him and Tucker tries to focus
He doesn’t usually wake up so disoriented but everything is slow and sluggish and there’s something screaming at him something telling him that
They’ve got Wash he says out loud and the memories slam back into him in horrific clarity
They’ve got Wash
Freckles shake
Wash’s voice cuts clear across his mind and something twists hard in Tucker’s chest
They had Wash again this was just like last time except it wasn’t because Wash was alone and because he hadn’t sacrificed himself like some big dumb hero this time; he had called for his team he had called for Tucker and Tucker hadn’t gotten there in time
He starts snapping on his armor frantic and hurried
His movements are so erratic that he spends nearly thirty seconds trying to put his boot on the wrong foot before he gets a grip
Once every piece of armor is on its proper appendage he grabs his sword and his rifle and makes for the door
Ummmm Tucker
Where are you going
I’m going to get Wash Tucker says
Oh Caboose says and throws back his covers
Well then
I’m coming with you
Caboose Tucker winces as Caboose sways
C’mon don’t be an idiot
Ohhh I think not
Tucker turns as Dr Grey sweeps through the door and pushes Caboose gently back onto the bed tugging the blankets up around his waist
Now really
I am all for a dramatic rescue mission but you my friend are not up to it quite yet
She glances disapprovingly at Tucker
And neither are you
You hardly slept a single wink last night
How would you know
Tucker snaps one hand still on the infirmary door
Because I heard you silly she says calmly
That gives Tucker pause
Heard me doing what
Calling for Wash
It’s a few seconds before Tucker can speak and when he does he hardly recognizes the cadence of his voice
Keep an eye on him will you
He nods his head at Caboose
Dr Grey frowns
Captain Tucker
But Tucker’s gone yanking the door open and marching out into the hallway
He makes it a grand total of ten steps before his progress is waylaid by no less than three cadets and four feds
Britton Jensen Kennedy and all of the Fed captains
Jesus Christ Tucker snaps as they melt out of the shadows and block his path
There you are Perry says
We’ve been looking everywhere for you
Oh Tucker says for lack of any other real way to respond to that
Why
Because we want to know what the plan is
Jensen says
She’s got her helmet on but Tucker can picture all too-well just how wide those big eyes are behind her glasses
The plan
The plan to rescue Agent Washington
That’s what I’m about to go find out Tucker says darkly and continues on his way
Britton literally body blocks him bouncing off of Tucker’s chest and leaning back to glare up at him
You mean we’re going to find out
She’s been practicing that line all morning Fitz mutters
Like literally all
Shut up Fitz
I have not
Alright stop Tucker says
He glances pointedly at Britton’s shortened arm
She’s done something to the armor so that it caps and seals right at the bicep and the amputation is more obvious than ever
Yeah Wash is going to kill me and you if you go charging off on a rescue mission with that arm
I can still fly she says fiercely
I can
Tell him Jensen
She can
Jensen agrees
We’ve been practicing on the one of the out of commission Pelicans
I rewired it so that she can do everything with one arm until she gets a prosthetic
I can do it I swear
Britton chimes back in
It took some trial and error but
You know what why don’t we just put a pin in the arm thing Tucker says hastily
He makes a mental note to not be around when someone explains to Kimball just what the cadets have done to one of their out of commission Pelicans
Look does anyone know where Kimball or Doyle are
Or no Carolina
She’s probably gonna be more useful right now
They all glance at Ali who puts a hand up to his helmet
They’re in the landing bay he says
Andersmith’s got a tail on them
The landing bay
Good
That could only mean that a plan was in action
Tucker hastens forward not bothering to protest when they all surge forward to follow him
You’ve got a tail on them he asks
Of course Britton says importantly
We don’t want to miss any information that we might need
Right
Their talk continues as they continue towards the landing bay but Tucker is barely aware of it
He keeps up a steadying stream of uh huh right yeah and it isn’t until they’re almost there at he realizes he’s still doing it even though the conversation has stopped
Tucker glances around to see them all staring at him
Ali throws an arm out to stop Tucker’s progress and when he speaks Tucker can hear the frown in his voice
Tucker listen you gotta pull your shit together man
If you go in there and act all like irrational
Tucker shrugs him off impatiently charging through to the landing bay
He should have been there hours ago shouldn’t have bothered trying to sleep
He rounds the corner to see several Pelicans ready and waiting for them as well as a fully equipped task force of all their best soldiers
Or he doesn’t
Tucker actually stops and gives his head a little shake at the sight that greets him
Instead of the Pelicans ready to go instead of their best soldiers he sees only Carolina and Kimball sitting on one of the benches
Carolina has her elbow on her knee and her head resting in her hand and Kimball has her tilted so closely forward that their heads are almost touching
They both glance up at the sound of Tucker entering the room the cadets and Feds filtering in behind him
Tucker glances around the landing bay one more time nope not a single Pelican ready not a single one and is just getting ready to unload on them when a thought occurs to him
Stealth
Maybe wherever they were holding Wash required stealth to get to as opposed to a whole army
Or something
So what’s the plan
Kimball looks at Carolina
Looks at Tucker
Looks at the group of soldiers clustered behind him
Tucker
What is this
This Kennedy says is Agent Washington’s rescue team
There’s a clacking sound and Tucker hears Fitz tut
Did you just cock your shotgun for dramatic effect
I thought it was pretty cool Patil says
Yeah you would Would you guys stop
They’re never gonna take us seriously if you don’t
They’re not gonna take us seriously anyway
Not with that attitude
Come on guys
Kimball is leveling a glare so fierce at him that Tucker thinks it might burn a hole in her visor
Look I didn’t bring them here he says impatiently
I just wanna know what the plan is to go get Wash
Tucker Kimball sighs glancing at Carolina
Look
Don’t Tucker says alarmed
Don’t don’t tell me that we have to fucking wait or some shit
That’s not what I’m saying Kimball says calmly
What I’m saying is that we need to be smart about this
We don’t have time to be smart about it
Tucker says
We don’t have much time here at all
You don’t know that she snaps
And I don’t want anyone else falling into a trap because we were stupid about this
Tucker forces himself to take a breath
Neither do I he says keeping his voice low and even
I just look I just want to know what the plan is
Do we have any idea where Wash is
None Epsilon says
He pops up over Carolina’s shoulder
If he still had his radio in his helmet I’d be able to track it butwell we all saw what they did to that
Isn’t there anything else you can track
Tucker asks desperately
There’s all kinds of crazy shit in our suits isn’t there like a chip or His suit’s completely offline Epsilon says so there’s not even a chance of me finding his GPS system
What about the Pelican
Britton asks nudging her way up closer to Tucker
Can you track the bird they took him away in
You can’t just track a Pelican Fitz says
"Not like that
" Um excuse you are you a pilot
No and neither are you
I am too
She’s the best pilot this army’s got
Thanks for that astute analysis Jensen
Britton’s right Epsilon interjects
She’s right butlook in order to do that I’d have to track the radio signal which won’t work because-- Are we gonna understand a word of this
Tucker asks irritated
Epsilon glares at him
We need to do this the old-fashioned way Carolina says
Human bodies gathering intel
We send out several small teams to where we think there may be activity or where there’s been activity in the past
But they may not even be on this planet anymore Tucker says desperately
They could be anywhere
Carolina sighs
I know
I know butwe have to start somewhere
She looks at him
This isn’t a smash and grab Tucker
Not yet
When it is
We’ll make them regret ever so much as looking in Wash’s direction
She’s right
Tucker knows she’s right
It doesn’t stop him from wanting to scream
It doesn’t stop him from wanting to tear the planet apart with his bare hands
Fine he says instead
Fine
Let’s let’s get these stealth teams or whatever all set up and then we leave tomorrow
He glances at Kimball
Right
Right she says
Tomorrow day two
Tomorrow arrives with a scream
It slams in with no warning a howling burning thing that propels Tucker to his feet
He comes to his senses much more quickly now than he did yesterday
It is still dark too dark to be dawn and he is on the Pelican
He’d fallen asleep here last night right there in the cockpit wanting to get moving as soon as they could
Tomorrow he’d chanted at himself
It was the only thing that kept him from flying off alone
Tomorrow tomorrow tomorrow
Tomorrow is here and it is burning
He hastens into the rest of his armor stumbling out of the Pelican to get a closer look
The skyline is on fire burning just outside their city walls and he can hear the sound of grenades and rifles and screaming
Tucker lunges for the big red panic button in the landing bay and the base is soon filled with the sounds of alarms
He takes off running towards the screams heart thudding in his throat
He opens up the channel he shares with the other sim troopers
Anyone know what the fuck’s going on
We’re under attack
Sarge hollers sounding Tucker notes more gleeful than anything
Cowboy up boys
To the perimeter
I’m already on the perimeter
Sarge
Simmons now
His voice cracks on the last word and Tucker winces as another BOOM sounds louder than the first
Sir what are you doing here it isn’t even your shift
I make m’own shifts Simmons
Now cover me
There's a lot of confused yelling and Tucker breaks into a sprint
He nearly crashes full-on into Perry who speeds out of an adjacent hallway
They both skid to a halt Perry’s hand shooting out to catch Tucker’s arm as he stumbles
He pulls Tucker along with him towards the source of the chaos
Bodies
There are bodies on the ground
It’s the first thing Tucker registers as he and Perry emerge onto the outer walls of the base
There’d been a lot of eye-rolling when they’d all arrived in Armonia at the fifteen-foot wall Doyle had constructed around the city but now Tucker is grateful for it
The city was incredibly well-protected enough that there were still a fair number of civilians living there
Tucker hopes they’d all had the sense to retreat to one of the underground shelters
He can see a whole section of the city under fire
Perry curses under his breath as they take in the scene then turns to Tucker
We have to go out there
Tucker nods following him to one of the exits into the city proper
Donut and Fitz come whipping around a corner and Donut waves him off as they advance
No good
That way’s all plugged up
The four of them backtrack into a nearby alleyway wincing as another BOOM rocks the ground
What the fuck is going on
Tucker asks
He scans the skies for signs of enemy Pelicans but there’s nothing no Pelicans no mercs no space pirates
We’re under attack Fitz yells
Yeah no shit
Tucker cranes his neck out from behind the way trying to get eyes on the enemy
Still nothing
I meant why
What do they want
Fitz shoots him a look
They want to royally fuck up our shit
Does it matter
Let’s go kill some assholes
Hey
He drops a hand on Tucker’s shoulder leans in close
Maybe we can get one of them to tell us where they’re keeping Wash
Tucker can get on board with that
They’ve no sooner inched their way out into the streets pressed back to back in a reverse huddle when there’s a whine overhead a whine Tucker’s heard a thousand times
Find cover he yells but Fitz is already yanking him back and the four of them crouch down arms over each other as there’s another BOOM far louder than the previous ones
That wasn’t a grenade Perry gasps as the world quiets
That was a
Bomb Fitz says and he’s off and running before the rest of them can blink twice
Come on
Tucker yells and they follow him
The four of them dash towards the fire and Tucker can hear the sounds of screams getting louder and louder
They finally run into some of the space pirates on the way and there’s a brief but fierce firefight
Fitz is once again the first on his feet and they finally make it to the source of the bombing a group of row homes almost completely flattened
He turns back to the rest of them
I see people alive down there
We need to
Tucker’s brain barely registers what happens next
There’s the loud CRACK of a rifle as Fitz’s head snaps to the side and his body crumbles to the ground
Perry screams a wordless howl and it’s not until he’s running to Fitz’s side and shaking him that Tucker realizes that he’s dead
Tucker spins and to see a space pirate climbing weakly to his feet rifle raised and pointing at them
Ali is faster putting a bullet neatly through the pirate’s visor and leaving Tucker time to charge forward to where Perry is bending over Fitz’s body
He yanks Perry back as another bullet sinks into the ground where he was just kneeling
Perry’s yelling and so is Tucker although he has no idea what either of them are saying there are too many noises and too many bodies and too much fire and Tucker pulls him back into the half-blown out shell of a garage as Donut covers them
Wash is gone and Fitz is dead and there are people out there dying and Tucker doesn’t know why doesn’t know the reason for any of it and suddenly doesn’t care he just wants it to stop
They sink to the ground and stay there for minutes or hours or days clutching so tightly to each other’s arm that Tucker can’t tell which one of them is shaking
Perry makes it to his feet first and holds a hand out to Tucker
Let’s go he says
His voice his thick with tears and he doesn’t even bother to hide it and that’s important Tucker thinks
Perry just watched one of his best friends die and he’s crying but he’s still there on his feet holding a hand out to Tucker and that’s important
Tucker takes it
They go day three
Eighty-five fifty-two thirty-three
Tucker repeats the numbers to himself over and over again until they don’t even sound like words anymore
Eighty-five fifty-two thirty-three
Eighty-five dead fifty-two civilians and thirty-three soldiers
Dead
The morning is chilly and quiet
It’s not quite raining but there’s a fine layer of mist over everything their visors the buildings the bodies
They gather the bodies and strip them of their armor put all of the dog tags into a little box that Donut volunteers to keep watch over
The act takes nearly all day
They work in shifts filtering in and out of the base mechanic silent
Tucker doesn’t realize he’s spent the better part of three shifts removing armor from the dead and piling it up until he feels a tug at his elbow and turns to see Ali
His helmet is off tucked under his arm dark eyes wide and unseeing but he pulls at Tucker’s arm anyway
Food he says
C’mon
Tucker nods and the two of them make their way inside the base their progress halted by Palomo standing in the doorway staring off into space
Palomo Tucker says tiredly what the fuck are you doing
Palomo says nothing just continues to stare off somewhere behind Tucker
He startles when Tucker puts a hand on his shoulder and gives him a little shake
Palomo
Jesus Christ
Now Palomo’s staring at him with that same blank expression and Tucker sighs
You look like shit
Come on
We’re going to get food
He turns Palomo around and marches him into the main entranceway
They all falter slightly at the sight that greets them there are soldiers seated all around the hallway Feds and News alike staring off into space the same fashion as Palomo
Tucker can see Jensen and Prajapati wrapped so tightly around each other that he can barely tell whose limbs are whose Matthews huddled in a corner with his head pressed into his knees Caboose patting Andersmith on the arm Britton with her head on Perry’s shoulder her good hand clutched tightly in his
They are largely still and silent and after a momentary hesitation Tucker joins them finding a free spot against the wall and pulling Palomo down with him
Ali wanders into the crowd and returns a few minutes later with some coffee and donuts
I think the war started with the first bombing Ali says after a while
I mean
It started way before that but for most people I think they remember those bombs first
They were loud Palomo says absently and they turn to him
My headphones couldn’t drown them out
It didn’t start there for me Ali continues when Palomo offers nothing more
When I when I think of the beginning I think of the the pictures some of my students used to turn in
Paintings drawings they were all of the bombs
Their burned out houses
Bits of their families
Kids you know
Justkids
Tucker opens and closes his mouth several times utterly at a loss for what to say
He finally settles on I didn’t know you were a teacher
Wasn’t Ali says with a sigh
He rests his head back against the wall
I didn’t get that far
TA’d a few classes to get through grad school
I liked it thougheverything about it
The kids
The teaching
When they bombed the school I He trails off and Tucker registers that he’s fiddling with something in his hands
Fitz’s dog tags
Perry had been wearing them all morning and Tucker isn’t sure when he took them off
Even as he watches Patil walks past them both and holds out his hand
Ali drops the dog tags into them without another word
The day drags
When they burn the bodies they do not separate them into soldier and civilian
They all died together Kimball says
They shouldthey should be together for this too
The smoke rises high against the dying sun and Tucker cannot watch the bodies burn
He looks across the way and stares at Donut instead the pink of his armor just visible through the smoke box of dog tags clutched tightly in his arms
Tucker has nothing of Wash’s he realizes suddenly no dog tags no piece of special clothing or jewelry nothing
He can’t think of a single material item that Wash held dear
The things closest to his heart were intangible fleeting things misting and melting away in the smoke leaving Tucker’s hands empty and aching and cold day four
Day three bleeds into four and Tucker finds himself outside of Kimball’s office without even knowing how he ended up there
He’s just lifting his fist to knock ready to raise all sorts of hell when the sound of raised voices causes him to falter have done everything you’ve asked someone is yelling
And now I’m telling you what I need and you’re telling me that I can’t go
Carolina
Tucker’s heard her yell enough times to recognize her voice instantly but there’s something different about it some deeper personal hurt seeping through her words
I’m trying to keep as many people alive as I can
Including you Kimball responds
She isn’t full-on yelling like Carolina is but her voice is tense and unhappy
Do you think this is a coincidence that they hit us this hard right after they took Wash
That attack was deliberate and
Of course it was deliberate
Tucker jumps as he hears Carolina’s footsteps but she isn’t leaving the room only pacing
They’re trying to scare us Vanessa and I’m not afraid of them
Well you should be
How can you look at
Do you have a death wish
Tucker jumps startled to find Grif standing next to him incredulous
Huh
Grif tuts grabbing Tucker’s arm and yanking him down the hall
They’ve been fighting all morning
You should’ve seen Carolina scream at Sarge after he tried to get in the middle of it
I think it’s best if you wait this one out
I don’t Tucker yanks his arm out of Grif’s grasp
We don’t have time to wait Grif
Christ it’s like no one here cares that Wash is still fucking gone and we haven’t heard shit
Hey
You aren’t the only one here who cares about Wash
Grif actually sounds a little pissed off when he says it which startles Tucker enough that he falters
If you would just talk to the rest of us instead of sulking like a big baby you’d realize that
I am talking to you Tucker says indignantly
That’s all I’ve been doing is trying to fucking talk to people
No it’s not
Grif snaps
You’re not talking to us
And don’t think we’ve noticed that you haven’t been sleeping or eating
Grif Tucker interrupts
He takes a breath trying to fight down the hysteria bubbling up in his chest
They’ve had him for four days four days do you know what they’re probably doing to him
No I don’t Grif says
And neither do you
Grif
The hysteria wins this time rushing up into his voice and choking out into his words
It’s been four days and we haven’t heard anything he’s what if he’s what
He’s not dead Grif says firmly
You don’t know that Tucker says
He can barely speak anymore
You don’t
Know
That
Yes I do Grif says
Listen
Kimball’s right
This isn’t a coincidence that they nab Wash and then drop a fuckton of bombs on the city
They’re trying to shake us up
They’re trying to distract us from going after him
Why
Grif shrugs
Fuck if I know
But they’re planning something
So Tucker considers and takes a breath
So what do we do
We go after him
They turn to see Sarge approaching glancing left and right as if he’s expecting to be followed
Uh no Grif says alarmed
I mean yes but not like you’re suggesting
And what am I suggesting
Sarge says indignant
I’m not entirely sure Grif says but whatever it is I’m sure it’s half-cocked and likely to get the three of us killed
The three of us
Tucker interrupts
Grif falters and they stare each other down
Yes the three of us he snaps finally
I cannot in good conscious let you go off on some stupid mission alone with no one but Sarge can I
It’s perfect Sarge says brightly
We’ll need some bait and who better than
Oh my God you’re starting already
Seriously
Tucker breathes the hysteria sinking slowly back down through his throat his chest to settle in his stomach
So
What’s the plan day five
The planet is silent and still
They take a Pelican before first light
Grif flies them around the planet and Tucker and Sarge creep out to search while he waits
They find nothing
Nothing at the way stations
Nothing in the cities
Nothing in the skies
Nothing on the UNSC Tartarus
They do not run into a single enemy soldier
They find nothing
Tucker didn’t realize just how much hope he was holding out that their stupid half-cocked plan would work until it doesn’t
Their stupid half-cocked plans always work
He can’t look anyone in the eye when they return not Carolina not Kimball not Caboose or any of the cadets
He can’t go to his room either so he paces until he finds a quiet hallway where he can lay down and rest his eyes for a moment only for a moment day six
It’s another misty morning and Tucker paces for lack of anything better to do
He can’t stay still
It feels as if his very bones are alive inside his body cracking into dust
Tucker finds himself wondering again if Wash is cold
They would have taken his armor long ago and they almost certainly took his Kevlar suit as well
It’s too hard to cut through Tucker thinks
He tries to backtrack recoiling away from the thought but his brain latches on catching on the inevitable loss of Wash’s armor
Tucker wonders if they removed it on the Pelican or back at their base
If he was unconscious when they took it away or if he fought them for it piece by piece
And the Kevlar it was fucking difficult trying to get someone out of their undersuit
He has taken Wash’s suit off himself enough times to know that it wasn’t easy going that the suit always caught around Wash’s shoulders and his hips
Something clenches hard in Tucker’s stomach at the thought and he leans over dropping his head between his knees and breathing deep
He closes his eyes and tries not to think of Wash’s suit getting caught around his shoulders under Felix’s hands
Tries not to think tries not day seven
Tucker is so sick with worry and fear that he almost misses his weekly chat with Junior
Oh fuck he groans when he realizes he’s ten minutes late to the video call
Great
In addition to being a bad captain a bad soldier and a bad boyfriend he’s now a bad father
Fantastic
He runs into his room and slams the door behind him sinking onto his bed and frantically loading up the video server on his datapad
Come on come on come on you stupid fucking thing load It loads
Tucker literally feels his shoulders wilt in relief as Junior’s face fills the screen
He’s chatting in Sangheilli at one of his friends standing next to him and Tucker watches for a while letting the familiar sound of Junior’s voice wash over him
After a few moments Junior catches sight of Tucker’s face in the screen
Father he says voice equal parts relief and delight
You came
Of course I came Tucker says
Sorry I was late little man
It’sthings are crazy here right now
Junior nods in understanding and Tucker hates himself even more
You are fighting a war
I understand
Not an excuse Tucker mumbles
So uh
Go on tell me about the game
Did you win
Junior’s face lights up and Tucker pushes all of his thoughts and stress aside as he chatters away
He’s genuinely listening to what Junior has to say and somewhere in the enthusiastic chatter for just a moment Tucker forgets himself
They talk for longer than usual and the way Junior keeps pausing to eye him Tucker thinks he might suspect that something is wrong
He does not ask though and for that Tucker is grateful
When Junior logs off the silence is sudden and suffocating
Tucker flops back onto his pillows before he realizes what he’s doing before he catches the faintest whiff of Wash’s scent spies just a few strands of Wash’s hair stuck to the sheets
He jolts away as if the bed has scalded him and starts yanking open drawers pulling out fatigues and underwear and clean socks
Donut spies him just as he’s stumbling out of his room takes one look at the clothes in Tucker’s arms and sighs
Come on
You can keep them in my room
Donut leads the way and Tucker follows standing awkwardly in the doorway as Donut clears out a whole fucking drawer for him and folds Tucker’s clothes neatly into their new space
He makes a little mattress for Tucker on the floor and although it’s not okay nothing is okay Donut’s snores are soothing and familiar and they lull him off to sleep day eight
Tucker wakes up in a fit of panic on the floor of Donut’s room and fumbles for his datapad
He’d been dreaming he thinks dreaming of Wash but his face hadn’t looked quite right and Tucker couldn’t figure out why
The freckles were wrong
Wash had a little cluster on one of his temples and Tucker suddenly couldn’t remember which side they were on
He’d thought it was the right but what if it wasn’t what if it was the left
He can’t be forgetting this
It’s only day eight and he can’t be forgetting so soon because what does that mean for day eighteen
What does that mean for day thirty
What does
Tucker loads up his datapad and swipes frantically through his camera roll until he finds what he was looking for those stupid selfies he’d taken with Wash in the day of the training room
He hadn’t been able to look at them until now but it’s important so very important that he remember what side the cluster of freckles were on
The right
Those ridiculous freckles were on the right temple
Tucker exhales in shaky relief leaning back down on the floor
The right day nine
Carolina and her recon teams have found nothing nothing at all
Tucker was pulled off of recon days ago but he still hovers still listens on the radio still waits
Nothing
Carolina’s anger at the lack of results is a constant simmering thing and one day Tucker pauses on his way to the mess hall unsure if he's actually seeing this
Prajapati is standing dead center helmet at her feet leaning forward as if into a stiff wind and shouting at Carolina
Her helmet is off as well and there is a small crowd beginning to gather
"--can't believe you just expect us to run fucking laps like we're robots or whatever bullshit
We're not heartless like you and we need time--" He sees Jensen spill out from a training room and grab Prajapati stammering apologies as Epsilon flares to life
Tucker blinks shakes his head and moves on into the mess hall where he pushes food around on his tray before going to pass out on Donut’s floor day ten
Tucker spends a lot of time not thinking which is waaaay better than the thinking he has been doing because it all winds into these vicious circles that leave him literally swaying on his feet
He has been trying to picture it
Trying to picture the physical violence Wash must be enduring wondering if he was hurting now right this very second if he has broken bones or bruised ribs - would that make it seven times now
Tucker traces his hands along his own body trying to picture it
Trying
He knows that Wash is strong and he has seen Wash endure so very much physical damage
Wash can handle anything
He knows this
He knows
Felix and Locus probably know too
He wonders if they know about Wash's mind about how Wash gets confused wonders if there's a way they could hurt him that way too
Wonders
It's hours later when Tucker blinks the water out of his eyes to find Dr Grey pulling him from a freezing shower that he doesn't remember getting into told on by someone he doesn't remember being there
Wash likes the water he tells her
It’s important that he explain that she understand
He in Freelancer after the rain
He can’t piece the words together in the right way and he realizes that his teeth are chattering
Dr Grey doesn’t scold him or question him or say anything at all 
She simply leads him through the halls pats his hand and tucks him into a bed in the infirmary day eleven
Tucker sits next to Carolina on the highest wall of the base
He can’t remember if she joined him or he joined her only that they found themselves here together Epsilon pacing in front of them
Tucker watches his avatar until the blue burns his eyes and even then he doesn’t look away
Epsilon Carolina finally says
Answer the question
The question the question the question
What was the question
It was important
It had something to do with Wash and eleven days and the odds
Tucker tries to weave these threads together but finds it too difficult and simply holds onto the ends of them instead
He can’t think
His brain feels like mush
He isn’t sure when last he slept
Epsilon stops pacing and looks at them both his shoulders rising and falling helplessly
The odds aren’t good okay
Eleven days in the hands of the enemy with no contact
The odds aren’t good
Right Carolina says
She looks at Tucker
Looks at Epsilon
What if we
No Epsilon says tiredly
C no
She sets her jaw and glares at him
You don’t even know what I was going to say
What yes I do
And it’s not going to work
Epsilon I can’t just sit here
Neither can I
He resumes pacing hands clenching and unclenching restlessly in front of him
Tucker’s seen Wash do the same thing when he was stressed and he wonders just who picked it up from who
Justgive me a second to figure this out okay
I can do this I canI can do this
Okay Tucker says
Epsilon turns to stare at him
Okay he asks the barest hint of uncertainty underlying his tone
Okay Tucker says again
Yeah
Okay
Okay Epsilon says then nods firmly to himself
Okay okay okay day twelve
You think Wash is dead
Don’t you
Tucker blinks disoriented
It’s dark and he’s in his armor on the floor
Caboose’s floor
How did I get on your floor
Caboose sniffs
You were sleeping in the mashed potatoes
You ah
You probably thought that they would be a nice pillow because they are very soft and fluffy but they aren’t very comfortable
Yeah
And Emily said if she saw you sleeping in places not meant for sleeping again she would put needles in you to make you sleep and well I don’t like the sleeping needles
Tucker stares at him
So I brought you here Caboose says
His eyes are huge owlish in the moonlight
But now I am thinking I should have left you in the mashed potatoes because you think Wash is dead and I don’t think that’s very nice
I don’t think Wash is dead
Tucker protests
He pulls himself to a sit
Caboose I don’t
Liar
I’m not lying
Then why are you crying
Tucker freezes before wiping at his cheeks horrified to find them wet
I didn’t
I wasn’t
Everyone thinks Wash is dead Caboose says still in that same angry voice
And if everyone thinks Wash is dead then there are no people to go and rescue him
Tucker stares at him for a moment
You really think he’s alive
There were bombs Caboose says
And we buried a lot of bodies
But we didn’t bury Wash’s body
And if we didn’t bury Wash’s body then he isn’t dead
Tucker grits his teeth pressing the heels of his palms into his stupid wet eyes
It doesn’t work like that Caboose
Yes it does
No it doesn’t
I still think he’s alive Caboose says stubbornly
And you need to think so too
Or I will leave you in the mashed potatoes next time
You can’t tell me what to think Tucker snaps
I would not have to if you didn’t think such stupid things
Tucker snorts
The giggle bubbles up through his chest and he forces it down forces it down with all the other swirling screaming madness curled up tight inside of him
Forces
Sunlight sunlight sunlight
It spills into his room but it’s all wrong
It’s too bright far brighter than the window that let the starlight into his room during Freelancer
No
That was before Wash thinks
That was before and this is now and He squeezes his eyes shut harder
Tries again
Sunlight sunlight sunlight
It spills into his room but it’s all wrong because he is used to sleeping in Tucker’s room where the light is red and falls across his eyes and he has to squint to see Tucker and
Agent Washington
How are you feeling
The voice has him snapping his eyes open immediately only to force them closed against the light once more
That wasn’t real Wash tells himself
That wasn’t real because he knows that voice and that voice is gone long gone it is gone because he killed that voice
Did you though
Sunlight
Sunlight
Sunlight
It spills into his room and it isn’t quite right
The window in his bunk on the UNSC Tartarus is tiny too tiny to let in such a large amount of harsh light and besides he never saw the sun there
Lies
Something deep inside him screams howls rages against the memories
Lies lies lies all of them lies they are lying to him they are
Put them away
He has to put the memories back in their boxes
Has to put the lies away
Has to
Agent Washington can you hear me
Light blue dark blue green red black
He needs a new box a box for the lies but there are so many
His head is too full and he cannot fit anything else in there; it is going to explode
He needs to put the lies away in their boxes but he doesn’t know what the lies are and
Your name is Agent Washington
Your friends call you Wash
The thought snags him and he holds onto it lets it become the eye of the storm that he will build around
The who always the who first
The where second
Agent Washington
Wash opens his eyes
No
He knows the who of that he is positive your name is Agent Washington your friends call you Wash you are on Blue Team but the where is impossible the where is all wrong
He left this where behind long ago left it lying in the darkest reaches of his memory
He cannot be here it is impossible that he is here and yet the window is the same the sheets are the same the
Can you hear me
When they ripped Epsilon away from him it had left a yawning bloody cavern straight through the center of Wash’s mind
Wash has fallen into it before although fallen was not quite the right word he had jumped taking with him everything he knew about Alpha and Allison and Freelancer and the Director
They could not reach him down there in that bottomless pit where he himself did not even know his own name
It had taken him years to claw his way back out and he has since learned to build around the trench to lay sturdy floorboards over it so that he could walk without fear of falling to stack the boxes up high enough to keep them safe
He has been careful so careful and although he has teetered on the edge several times in recent years although he has had to rebuild the floor and restack the boxes he has been okay
But now as he looks at the face of the man sitting next to him at his bedside a man who should not be here could not be here
He looks at that face and almost falls back in
Wash catches himself just in time scrambling away from the edge of madness
You he croaks his voice weak and parched
You
The Counselor tilts his head sympathetically reaching out to rest a hand on Wash’s arm
Agent Washington you have been through quite an ordeal
Wash jerks away from the contact only to find that his wrists are bound at the side of his bed of his hospital bed
Hospital
Restraints
Blue scrubs a dirty window white sheets
Don’t touch me he snarls trying again to pull away from the Counselor
The Counselor does withdraw his arm but not until he has let it sit there for several seconds longer than necessary
Agent Washington
Stop saying my name Wash grits
He glances around the room looking wildly for something anything that seems out of place
Where am I
You are in an off-site Recovery ward the Counselor says
We brought you here after the ship crashed
What ship
Wash asks his voice rising even as he knows what the Counselor’s words will be next
The Mother of Invention of course
There is the barest hint of bewilderment in the Counselor’s voice as if there couldn’t possibly be another ship as if this is an answer that Wash should know
It’s a subtle thing masterfully hidden and Wash knows this because he has already spent two years being manipulated by this asshole
Wash it sounds to me as if you were psychologically abused
No Wash says
He turns away and looks up at the ceiling searching for something to ground himself
The ceiling offers little comfort particularly when he finds that it has the same two missing tile pieces as his room in Recovery
How long had he spent bound to his bed staring at the ceiling counting the tiles and always getting stuck on these missing two
No he says again louder
No that’s not right
I’m on
I’m on a planet called Chorus and
Chorus
The Counselor’s voice still holds the same note of polite bewilderment and Wash knows he should say nothing more knows that every word out of his mouth will be ammunition this man could use against him but he’s panicking now there are two missing tiles in the ceiling and they are the same missing tiles
Chorus Wash confirms
He forces himself to breathe steady
In and out in and out
Don’t look at the ceiling tiles
Look at something else
The pale blue of his scrub pants
My my name is Agent Washington
My friends call me Wash and I am on a planet called Chorus
I am the leader of Blue Team and
Blue Team
The Counselor’s voice dips from bewilderment to disbelief before he catches himself
Agent Washington
STOP SAYING MY NAME
He lunges for the Counselor then forgetting about the restraints forgetting that he probably wouldn’t get very far even if they weren’t there
His muscles feel weak and sluggish his stomach is hollow and hungry his throat feels as if it has been scraped raw the back of his head is throbbing
He lunges anyway struggling so hard that his wrists start to bleed and he feels light-headed from panic
The Counselor is trying to say something but eventually gives up and presses a call button
A nurse enters the room a few minutes later dark hair in a braid down her back and she looks so startling familiar that Wash stops struggling
Sarita he croaks but even as he says the name he knows it isn’t right that wasn’t his nurse’s name but it was close this can’t be her but she looks so close
He’s so busy staring into her face trying to convince himself that she isn’t real that he doesn’t notice the sedative she pumps into his IV until it’s too late
She casts him a sympathetic smile something large and frightened behind her eyes
I’m sorry Wash she whispers as his vision turns fuzzy
I’m sorry
Samira he slurs as the world starts to blacken
That was it
Samira
Samira was the name of one of his nurses and she’d had the same long dark hair and fierce brown eyes but Samira couldn’t be here couldn’t be on Choruscouldn’t becouldn’t The last thing he sees is a flash of her black hair and the two missing ceiling tiles high above him
They keep him sedated after that
When the Counselor comes to call the next morning Wash can barely turn his head to meet his eye
Don’t he mumbles but he can’t get out any more than that
I’m worried about you Wash the Counselor says which is far far worse than his continuous use of Agent Washington
You sustained quite a blow to the head during the ship crash and we are concerned that it may have fractured your reality
You have been here for several months and
No Wash says
He shakes his head but the motion sets the room spinning so he stops
Not right
It isn’t right
He hasn’t been in captivity for several months he couldn’t have been it was absurd completely absurd
No one kept their enemies alive in captivity for months
No
Not captivity
The Counselor was saying that he had been in the Recovery ward for months but that wasn’t right either that was years ago and if it was right if he was really in Recovery he would’ve seen
Tronosky he says and the Counselor stops short
I’m sorry
Tronosky Wash says sounding out each syllable so that there could be no mistake about his words
Not here
Would be here
The Counselor regards him thoughtfully for a while before speaking
You are referring to your neurosurgeon
Dr Tronosky
Is that correct
Yes Wash says firmly
Yes
He’d Perhaps you don’t remember the Counselor continues
But hemoved on
He no longer works here
No
Tronosky to security we have a problem in room seventeen do you copy
No
He remembers he remembers
Tronosky hadn’t moved on they’d driven him off
He’d kept Wash safe for as long as he could; he had been the only thing standing between the Director and Counselor and Wash’s sanity for a month
He’d given Wash precious time to lay the barest foundation of his mind back down before they’d threatened him and he had to go
Wash doesn’t like the way the Counselor is looking at him now as if he’s just figured something out but he says nothing more that day just leaves Wash to count the tiles in the ceiling to count the memories inside his head
Later that day there is another nurse who visits him who is as achingly familiar as the first
Jason he says his name is and it’s not right
Jackson that was the name of his other nurse he’s positive Jackson Jackson Jackson but he looks so similar and Wash wonders if he’d ever remembered them right in the first place
The Counselor’s questions turn over the next few days from vague sympathetic observations to pointed inquiries
Tell me about your experience with the Epsilon AI
Agent Washington
Wash laughs
He laughs because it is absurd that the Counselor should be asking about this about Epsilon it has been years since he has had to keep that information secret
That information is tucked away the memories neatly divided and catalogued and kept far away from his own
You don’t want to know about the Epsilon unit he mutters
His sedatives have not been quite as heavy lately but his limbs still feel as if they are made of lead
It doesn’t matter anymore
Perhaps you don’t remember the Counselor says almost as if he is trying to reassure himself of this possibility but you tried to kill the Director
Can you tell me why you did that
IF I GO I’M TAKING YOU WITH ME
--his armor is burning burning with blue flame and he has no control over his hands as they point the pistol at the Director
--as he points the pistol at himself
--did I want to die do I still
They are slithering the memories slithering out of their neat little boxes lids clattering to the floor
Wash the Counselor says it is very important that you discuss this with me
Why
He isn’t sure whose voice it is that speaks up from his memory but he listens holding tight to the word
Why why why
Why did the Counselor want him to talk about this why did he want Wash to relive things that had long since been dead and buried
They are trying to scramble you up
The voice sounds oddly like Epsilon’s but even as he recoils from the sound Wash knows the words to be true
He doesn’t know why but
They are trying to make you break
He does not break
Wash can tell after a few days that the Counselor is frustrated
What he does not know is if the frustration is contrived or not and itt takes everything he has to not fall into the trap the Counselor is setting
He shoves every other thought instinct hope and fear aside and focuses only on this on not going down this rabbit hole
He does not answer the questions the Counselor throws at him does not engage in his what-ifs
It is impossible not to think of the Director or Alpha or Epsilon but he will not engage he will not discuss will not
His sleep that night does not dip below the surface and he is disoriented when his door slams open in the middle of the night the Counselor leading the way
Wash has never heard the Counselor raise his voice let alone slam open doors and he shoves his disorientation aside
Agent Washington he says calmly this is your last chance
I want you to tell me about your experience with the Epsilon AI and I want you to do it now
They are trying to scramble you up
No Wash says
His heart is pounding in his chest but he is committed to this
The Counselor stares at him and Wash stares back determined
He will not speak
He will not break the gaze
He will not
The Counselor does break their eye contact first but there is no time for any sort of relief to settle
Bring them in he calls towards the door
Wash watches bewildered as soldiers wearing the UNSC armor drag in two nurses the two nurses who look just like his nurses in Freelancer
Samira and Jackson
Before he can say anything before he can even catch their eye one of the soldiers raises a gun and puts a bullet through the center of their skulls
NO
Wash moves towards them before he remembers the restraints
They are dead eyes wide and unseeing blood and brains splattered on the wall across from Wash
No no why did you
He falters as a second soldier drags someone else in through the door someone in a crisp white lab coat with dark curly hair and thick glasses
Tronosky
Wash says the name before he can stop himself sick with shock and disbelief
No
It isn’t him because he couldn’t be here on Chorus
Why couldn’t he be
You don’t know where he went after Recovery he could have gone anywhere
Wash looks hard into the man’s face as he is forced to his knees
He is battered and bloody and clearly dazed but it’s him
Or it’s not
Wash can’t tell
It’s been so long and he can’t tell
The Counselor moves and Wash’s eyes snap to him heart clenching as he pulls out a pistol and levels it at Tronosky’s head
This is your last chance Agent Washington
Wash clenches his fists in the bedsheets twisting them round and round
I don’t
I don’t know what you want from me
I want you to talk to me
When I ask you a question I want you to answer it
I’m not answering any of your questions Wash spits
I’m not
I’m not answering any of your lies
You have already been responsible for two deaths here today
Would you like to be responsible for a third
You’re a monster Wash says
His heart is thudding so loudly in his ears that he can barely hear himself speak
A monster
The Counselor presses the gun more firmly into the man’s temple
I take that as a yes
I can’t
I don’t know what you want from me
Everything
His words suck all warmth from the room
Wait Wash says panicking wait
Farewell friend the Counselor says looking at the Tronosky who is not Tronosky
Wait wait DON’T--
Wash screams
The Counselor pulls the trigger and the man falls and Wash screams howls fights against his restraints with everything he has
He screams as they drag the bodies out as they haphazardly wipe up the blood and the brains and the pieces of skull
He screams until he is alone in the room alone with his thoughts alone alone alone
The blood stains the white tiles of Wash’s floor and he stares at it until he isn’t even sure what he’s looking at
That hadn’t been Tronosky couldn’t have been Tronosky but they’d killed someone they’d killed someone in front of him to make him cooperate
Wash isn’t even sure at this point what cooperating is only that he isn’t going to do it no matter what
His grip on sanity is a slipping thing but he holds tight to it skirting the pit in his head
When the Counselor comes in to speak that day he acts as if nothing has changed between them
Wash remains silent staring at the blood on his floor and the tiles in his ceiling
He does not look at the Counselor does not speak to the Counselor and he does not miss the satisfied look on the man’s face when he gets up to leave
There are new nurses that come to feed him and lead him to the bathroom twice a day fake nurses Wash thinks viciously fake this whole thing is fake but he spends two days getting their guard down allowing himself to be led limply around
On day three their guard finally drops and he waits until they are halfway across the room before half-turning and driving his elbow into the face of one of the nurses
He goes down with a howl and Wash turns his attention to the second one who spins pulling a gun out from under the waistband of his scrubs and aiming it at Wash
Wash manages to drive the thing up into the ceiling where it discharges several bullets
Not nurses not nurses not nurses
He wrests the gun away points it at the first soldier and fires two bullets into his midsection
The soldier drops with a surprised gurgle and Wash is just turning to look for the second one when there’s a click and something hard shoved into the back of his head
Back in the bed
Now asshole
Wash grits his teeth and does not move
Oh you think I won’t fucking do it
I’ve had to pretend to be your fucking nurse for two goddamn days
I would love the chance to shoot you in the fucking head and tell that creepy ass Price dude that it happened in the struggle
Give me a reason I swear to God
Slowly Wash raises the hand with the pistol and the mercenary snatches it away from him
Back in the goddamn bed
Now
He shoves Wash back into the bed and secures his wrists back into the restraints muttering to himself the whole time
Do not get paid enough for this bullshit swear to God
He storms out leaving Wash in the hospital bed with the other soldier bleeding out on the floor
Wash closes his eyes as the door slams shut behind him and tries to center himself
It takes a few moments to gather the thoughts that he wants towards him to suck them from the swirling mass of confusion and panic that is his mind but the thoughts do come
The violence the movement has jarred something loose in his brain and he can do this
Start simple
Start small
Your name is Wash
You are on a planet called Chorus
You have been taken by the enemy
He pauses here
The enemy
Charon Industries he remembers after a few moments
Charon and Felix and Locus
The Counselor
The enemy
There had been a fight a mission gone bad and he’d been shot somewhere in The leg
Wash opens his eyes and glances down automatically at his thigh before remembering that he can’t see the wound through the scrub pants
He flexes his thigh shifting around
There is a dull ache but nothing more than that
They must have removed the bullet and stitched him up
Why
His thoughts catch on the word and he frowns
Why did they fix his leg
They could have left the bullet in let the wound fester until he was sick and feverish
Instead they had taken the time and the resources to not only fix his leg but to To do this
Wash glances around the room at the perfect replica of his hospital room in recovery
He could spot the differences now that he was looking for them the window was a bit too large the sheets weren’t quite the right shade of white but the similarities were uncanny
They had deliberately recreated this room had tried to make him think that he was still in the hospital that he was still losing his mind that he was broken
They had filled his head with lies with new memories with a sick twisted version of his reality
His stomach heaves as the lies claw their way to the forefront the Tartarus the prisoners the grey armor with the aqua accents
Coming face to face with Carolina feeling the Counselor’s blood spilling out over his hands
Waking up in the snow to see not the brightly colored armor of the simulation troopers but the standard greys and blacks of the UNSC
Lies lies lies he knew they were lies but they felt so real he could taste them and maybe he couldn’t quite be sure
A hollow chill settles in his chest and Wash gives his head a firm shake
That wasn’t real he tells himself again
They Reds and Blues had stayed
They stayed and gave him blue armor and took him home to a base with ringing rocks and a waterfall
Tucker had made him pancakes and Caboose had given him his first real hug in years and Simmons had eventually stopped flinching whenever he walked in a room and they’d all baked him a birthday cake out of ration bars in Red base while the rain fell softly outside and Grif smoked a cigarette under the overhang and they’d found that old bottle of whiskey and did a shot that left them all gagging even Sarge
They had stayed
The hollow feeling in his chest lifts to replaced almost immediately with an ache that leaves him breathless
It is so simple that he almost cannot name it
He misses them
He misses his friends
Wash holds onto the feeling painful though it is
His friends
It is the first time that his mind has been clear enough to think of them properly and now that he has he cannot stop
He wonders what they’re doing right now
If they’re okay
If they all made it back from the battle safely or if there had been injuries or worse
He wonders
A door slams open somewhere and Wash tenses sitting up as straight in the bed as he is able with the restraints around his wrists
He can hear footsteps making their way down the hall and voices loud and angry told you to fucking watch him Jesus Christ do I have to do everything myself around here
We were watching him
He just fucking went nuts like the fucking Hulk
He doesn’t even have any weapons
He’s a Freelancer
A former Freelancer
He’s been lying in a bed for two and a half weeks
Jesus Christ
Just go
Just just go get Locus
I’ll take care of this
There’s nothing to take care of I told you he’s secured
The door slams open bouncing off of its frame and nearly clocking Felix in the face as it swings back
Wash knows it’s Felix immediately despite the fact that this is the first time he’s seeing the merc’s face
Felix is half out of his armor the grey and orange plating on his legs the only clues in addition to his voice as to who he is
Everything about him is plain utterly forgettable
Greying dark close-cropped hair and sharp brown eyes
Muscles long and lean built for speed
He’s older than the sim troopers older even than Carolina
Wash catalogues these details automatically without really caring about their meaning
Liar he snarls as soon as Felix throws the door open
Liar liar liar you’re all liars
Felix stops short staring at him before turning back to the guard
On second thought
I’m sorry you had to listen to this whining forhowever long you did
The soldier snickers
Right
I mean he is pretty dramatic am I right
Get out Felix snaps and the soldier is only too happy to obey
The door shuts and it’s only the two of them
Liar Wash spits again
The rage is burning so hot inside his skull that it feels as if his brain is about to melt out through his ears
You’re lying I know you’re lying this isn’t this isn’t real
He jerks hard against the restraints reopening the cuts that had finally closed
He knows he shouldn’t knows that he should remain impassive and indifferent but all of his training and knowledge has been shoved to the side in the face of this blinding anger
You done
Felix asks bored after watching him struggle for a while
Christ you’re a whiny little bitch
I know you’re lying Wash says again
His voice is shaking and he know he sounds crazy but he needs to make sure that they know this
You can tell me all the stories you want it won’t work I know you’re lying and it won’t work you’re wasting your time
Oh believe me
I couldn’t agree more
Wash stops yanking as his restraints only momentarily as Felix sighs wandering over to him
He sits down on the edge of Wash’s bed almost absentmindedly but Wash knows the motion is anything but
Now between you and me this whole brainwashing attempt
Complete waste of time and resources
I told them I said give him to me for a few days week tops and I’ll break him into so many little tiny pieces that he’ll do whatever we want him to do
But Price you know Price right
Price says no he’s had all sorts of RTI training physical torture won’t work blahdy-blah-d-blah
Wash’s wrists are slick with blood from where he’s fighting against the restraints but he can’t stop himself
His skin is crawling adrenaline and anger making it impossible to stay still the knowledge that he has probably been in a bed for weeks leading to a nearly unbearable sense of claustrophobia
It gets worse when Felix lunges for him suddenly one hand cupping his jaw and forcing Wash’s face to turn towards his
You’d think that after the fifth fucking time you threw off the illusion they’d let me do it my way but nooo
The moment hangs heavy in the air and Wash doesn’t break his gaze
He can feel his own pulse hammering like mad beneath Felix’s fingers
Oh that’s right Felix whispers watching him closely
I said the fifth time
You really have no idea just what we did in there do you
Just how much we crammed inside your head
The door opens again and Price and Locus both come in
You Wash snarls his gaze locking onto the Counselor as he redoubles his struggling
Felix tightens his grip on Wash’s jaw lifting an eyebrow at Locus
You see
It’s not working
Can we please just move along to the good part now
Locus is still in full armor so Wash cannot see his face but the displeasure in his voice is all too clear
You assured us that you knew what you were doing he says head turning slowly towards the Counselor
You assured us that replicating this scenario would lead to a break in Agent Washington’s mental state
Gentlemen the breaking has already begun
The Counselor moves slowly across the room to stand on the side of Wash’s bed and Wash lunges for him despite the restraints despite the fact that Felix is still holding tight to his jaw and neck
You he says again
You
I don’t want to hear any more of your fucking lies these smaller fractures that we are creating will do far more damage than a single break ever could
Shut up Wash growls
He pulls harder than ever against the restraints and Felix redoubles his grip
Shut up shut up shut up shut up
Look we don’t have time for this Felix interrupts
Locus
If Control knew how many resources we were wasting here I don’t think they’d be very happy do you
A long look passes between the two
Felix is right he says finally
I suggest we move along to the next phase of the plan
Whispers of Agent Washington’s death have already begun circulating throughout the army and it would not do to let them continue
It doesn’t matter Wash says suddenly
It doesn’t matter if they think I’m dead or not
It is late the Counselor says interrupting him again
I suggest that the three of us come up with the best possible strategy for the next phase and begin first thing in the morning
Fine Felix says finally letting go of Wash’s jaw
We’ll let Wash here get his beauty sleep
Right Wash
I think you’re gonna need it
Wash does not sleep that night and they do not bother with drugs to force him to do so
His dozing is fitful delirious and it seems to take years before dawn breaks through his window
The door to his room opens not soon after the daylight filters in and Wash turns sharply to see Locus and two of the space pirates approaching
Wash lunges the moment the undo his restraints but his movements are weak and sluggish and it’s too easy for the pirates to force his arms behind his back
They drag him out the door and down the hallway to a small dark room with no windows
It looks to be an office of some sort consisting of little more than a table and a chair
Wash is forced into a chair his arms yanked painfully behind him
The click of handcuffs fastening seems to echo in Wash’s ears and he freezes in his struggling before he can mask the motion
He knows that Locus saw it when he pauses in his act of closing the door behind the space pirates as they leave
It must be difficult for you he says suddenly
Wash stares at him then snorts
What being held captive by two crazy mercenaries and the man who ruined my life
I can’t imagine why you’d think that
Locus doesn’t answer at first just begins pacing a slow methodical circle around Wash’s chair
Does it remind you of prison Agent Washington
He is out of Wash’s line of sight when he says it and Wash has to force himself not to turn and look for him
I don’t
Locus’s hand clamps down on the back of his neck without warning directly above his implants and Wash actually gasps before furiously wresting himself back under control
Don’t react he screams at himself
Don’t react don’t react don’t
It’s impossible not to jerk when Locus runs a thumb down one of the scars on the back of his neck
The whole area feels swollen and painful and Wash is suddenly sick with the implications of what they’ve been doing inside his head
The pain is secondary though to the panic he feels at having someone at his back having someone with their hands on his neck
It must be difficult Locus says again his voice closer to his ear than Wash was expecting for a soldier of your caliber to be rendered so helpless for so long
Wash forces his breathing to remain relaxed and normal but Locus says nothing more
The seconds drag on and still Locus does not move just remains there with his hand cupped over the back of Wash’s neck and Wash doesn’t move doesn’t move an inch
His skin is crawling and Locus’s words pound in his brain over and over helpless helpless helpless
He’s almost grateful when the door slams open and Felix enters a small camera in his hands
Alright let’s get this party started I’ve been waiting forever for
He stops suddenly glancing between Locus and Wash
Oh I’m sorry am I interrupting something he asks his voice sounding oddly petulant and sulky
Locus finally steps away from him
Do you have the camera
Of course I have the camera Felix snaps
He’s still looking between the two of them
That’s literally the only reason I left was to get the fucking camera
Locus snatches it out of his hand and rests it on the desk glancing around for something to lean it against
Felix is glaring at Wash now and Wash glares back
They don’t break eye contact the entire time that Locus is trying to get the camera in the right position
He’s too pretty Felix says finally
He tilts his head at Wash
Yeah
Waaaay too pretty
A pause from Locus
What
I said he’s too pretty for this Felix snaps
Not a single mark on him
The army’s gonna think we’re putting him up in a five-star hotel with silk sheets every goddamn night
Locus glances up again from where he’s fiddling with the video camera
Agent Washington has lost a significant amount of weight he says
It is clear that he isn’t sleeping and has undergone a severe amount of stress
Stressed
That’s what we’re going for
Oh hey Armonia here’s Agent Washington look how stressed he is
You have no subtlety Locus snaps
They will be more far distressed to see that his wounds are more psychological than physical
I’m sorry are we or are we not about to torture him on camera
There’s nothing subtle about it
Look I’m telling you he looks too good
We need to mark him up a bit give them something to look at
If I may the Counselor says mildly
The bastard is so silent that Wash didn’t even see him arrive in the doorway
Felix isn’t entirely wrong
We are trying to drive them to do somethingrash
While some of Agent Washington’s comrades will notice his psychological state we may need something a bit more obvious to spur the others into action
Fine Locus says
He waves a hand at Felix dismissive and already turning back to the camera
Do it
Finally Felix says
He turns flexes his hands and wastes no time in hitting Wash across face so hard that he half-blacks out
When he comes to Locus is saying  gloves off Felix we need him conscious and coherent
Right right
Wash blinks the stars from his eyes to see Felix removing his gloves and for some reason his helmet
He tracks the motion as Felix sets his helmet down on the floor his stomach clenching uneasily
That all you get he grits out more to distract himself than anything
I’ve taken harder hits than that from the cadets in training
He’s ready for the blow this time as Felix strikes him in the face again in the same spot
You know Felix says when Wash straightens Continuing our little heart to heart from earlier
I gotta say this whole captivity thing has been really boring so far
I mean I’m sure the payoff will be totally worth it but
I was really hoping to have a little fun ya know
Felix hits him again in the stomach this time and Wash doubles over as all the breath leaves him
But our friend Price here says none of the usual stuff would break you
That it had to be a mental game carefully crafted blah blah blah
Between you and me I’m not entirely sure I agree
Given enough time and enough pressure anyone will break
Felix meets his gaze lets the moment sit before shrugging with a sigh
Ah well I guess we’ll never know will we
Another strike directly to his solar plexus this time Felix grips him tightly by the hair and yanks him up so their eyes meet before Wash can fully catch his breath
A shame really
I have such a thing for blonds
Felix’s fingers tighten in his hair eyes darkening as he leans closer
Instinct has Wash wiping his face clean of all emotion before he registers what Felix is about to do old training from Freelancer or farther back kicking in and telling him to be still
It takes everything in him to listen to those instincts as Felix he lowers his mouth to Wash’s neck teeth grazing over the pulse point before he seals his mouth around the skin there sucking hard
Wash clenches his hands into fists and doesn’t move doesn’t breathe doesn’t react even as he feels Felix’s teeth bite down again so sharply that his skin breaks
He keeps his face blank and disinterested as Felix pulls back enough to look him in the eyes his other thumb brushing over the painful mark he’d just left
He’s right isn’t he
Felix says with a sigh
You’d just disassociate the fuck out and then it wouldn’t be any fun at all
This is the kind of thing that would get to Tucker not to you
Felix brightens at that slapping a hand on Wash’s shoulder and spinning to face Locus
Oh-ho
Now there’s an idea
I don’t think Captain Tucker would like it very much if I had my hands all over his boyfriend here do you Locus
He doesn’t know that Wash reassures himself
He couldn’t know that he and Tucker werewhatever they were
Probably not Locus says absently and Wash is if possible even more unnerved by the fact that Locus seems utterly uninterested in this information
As if it were a given that he and Tucker were
Wait
Why did they care what Tucker thought
They should be far more concerned about what Kimball or Doyle thought or even Carolina
Not Tucker
Tucker held no sway over the deep internal workings of the military
They should be trying to get to the leaders trying to negotiate for information
They haven’t asked me a single question Wash realizes suddenly
Not a single
He’s so distracted by his thoughts that he loses the thread of what Felix is saying and almost misses the flash of silver as Felix unsheathes a knife from his waist
Wash is a moment too late in masking a hiss of pain as Felix takes the knife and draws it deliberately across his chest right over his heart from his collarbone to his sternum
The blood blossoms out from the wound the red startling in its vividness over the pale blue of his scrubs
Felix’s face fills his vision once more as he wipes the knife off on Wash’s shirt before resting the point against Wash’s cheek
Oh you know what I just realized he says suddenly
This was the knife that was inside Tucker
Wash’s stomach churns the pain of the knife slicing across his cheekbone second to the sickening knowledge that this was the weapon that had almost killed Tucker had scared him so badly that it took him months to be able to train with knives without shaking
We should let the wounds sit Locus says appearing at Felix’s shoulder and examining Wash critically
Twelve hours or so
See now that’s what I’m talking about Felix says in satisfaction
Oh wait one more thing
Felix bends down and scoops his gloves off the floor sliding them on before wrapping his hands around Wash’s throat and squeezing hard
The motion is unexpected leaving Wash no time to breath deep and it isn’t long before he’s jerking hard against the hold
Felix keeps squeezing right up until he point where Wash’s vision is red and his body is going limp before letting go
There’s a moment when everything is red just before his muscles start to relax that he thinks quite clearly
Tucker would be really upset if he knew what was happening to me
He holds onto that thought as he starts to lose consciousness then clutches it closer still as Felix finally lets go and oxygen floods back in
Tucker would be really upset he thinks again the sounds of Felix and Locus and the Counselor leaving distant unimportant things in the face of this knowledge
He would be furious devastated if he knew about the violence and the mind games
Emily Wash thinks
Emily would be livid if she knew about the brainwashing the manipulation the drugs
She was going to want to strangle the Counselor herself when she saw the state of Wash’s neural implants because God only knew what was going on in his head at this point
It was going to take her so very long to put them back together once he was back home
Once he was rescued
Wash’s heart is pounding the pain of his new wounds utterly forgotten
He would be rescued he realizes because it wasn’t just Tucker and Emily who would be furious if they knew what was happening to him
He thinks of the way Caboose would want to hug him tighter than usual the way Sarge would put together some half-assed mission the way Carolina would cut through everyone in her path
He thinks of Donut and Grif and Simmons and even the cadets and the Feds
Thinks people would be really upset if they knew what was happening
People are probably going out of their minds with worry
People people people
I have people Wash thinks
He closes his eyes
People people people
People who were worried about him
People who were coming for him
People who cared for him who He holds onto this keeps it tucked away in the deepest safest corner of his mind protects it in every single way he has learned to do so over the years
They leave him there all day bound to that chair in the dark and he repeats that thought to himself over and over as the hours drag on
His muscles go numb at hour two his stomach starts howling in hunger at hour seven and his bladder finally loosens at hour nine but he grits his teeth and repeats their names over and over
People
Tucker and Carolina and Caboose and Emily
He sets the cadence of their names to the ticking of the clock lets the sound become soothing instead of maddening
Hour twelve
Sarge and Simmons and Donut and Grif
Felix and Locus reenter the room at hour fifteen and Wash pulls their names even more tightly around himself
His people
He wasn’t going to see them anytime soon but they were going to see him
Felix is saying something to him as he secures a piece of thick tape over Wash’s mouth and yanks his head up from where it was drooping but his words don’t matter
Felix doesn’t matter
Wash knows who matters and he fixes his gaze on the eye of the camera and pretends he can see them can see each and every one of them
The light on the camera turns green and Wash blinks at the green light and thinks inexplicably Epsilon
--and Caboose and Carolina and Tucker Emily and Sarge and Grif and Simmons and Donut
Caboose
And Carolina
And Tucker
Tucker Tucker Tucker day thirteen
Caboose spends the entire day telling stories about Wash to anyone who will listen
It is nearly unbearable
Tucker wants to die
He wants to cover his ears and scream and throttle Caboose and burn everything in this base that Wash has ever touched until it is nothing but ash and smoke
He doesn’t
He follows Caboose around as if there’s a rope binding them together (circles his world has compressed to circles from the army at large to the sim troopers to Blue Team)
He listens to Caboose’s stories some of them fake and some greatly exaggerated but there is truth in all of them there is Wash in all of them
Some of the soldiers leave abruptly
Some chime in with their own stories
Some cling to Caboose’s every word until there are a dozen or so of them sitting together closer than normal listening to the words
Caboose tells fifty-three stories that day and Tucker drinks in every one day fourteen
He wakes up on Donut’s floor in a panic the fuzzy pink sheets twisted around his legs
There’s something important about today that he’s forgotten and he flips frantically through his recent memories trying to drag it to the surface
Wash is gone
They don’t know where he is
They’re consistently losing battles
Fitz is dead
Eighty-five twenty-two thirty-three
It isn’t until he’s standing in the mess hall line that he realizes it’s been two weeks to the day since Wash had been taken
Two weeks
Two weeks without a single word
Tucker drops his tray back on the counter and turns abruptly sick with fury and guilt
Two weeks two weeks two weeks and he had almost forgotten the number of days
He has no dog tags no piece of jewelry or special article of clothing that belonged to Wash
He only has the numbers
He will not forget again day fifteen
Father are you sure there’s nothing wrong
Tucker startles in his chair snapping his eyes back to the monitor
Junior is watching him with a frown head tilted in concern
Yeah he says
Yeah I’m
The fine sticks in his throat
It’s too much the enormity of the lie and Tucker cannot speak around it
He shakes his head
Buries his face in his hands
Counts to ten
Junior interrupts him on eight
Is Wash okay
Tucker jerks his head up to blink at the screen astounded
What did you why would you think something was wrong with Wash
Youyou talk about him all the time Junior says
Except you didn’t last time we talked and you aren’t this time either
I talk about him all the time
Junior looks at him like he’s an idiot and Tucker is struck by how much of himself he sees in that face
Father seriously
I Tucker thinks back to their previous conversations and tries to remember what he could have possibly told Junior about Wash that stood out so much
What do I talk about
Junior pauses thinking
Well everything
How he taught you to throw knives and how he tied that rope between you guys so you wouldn’t be scared anymore and how you got him that bag of sugar and then he got you that special soap for your hair andI don’t know Father you just talk about him a lot
Oh Tucker says
It’s all he can manage so he says it again
Oh
I would like to meet him Junior says watching him closely
He sounds cool
I think I would like him
Yeah Tucker says his throat tight
I think you would too day sixteen
Carolina is angry and Tucker loves it
He loves it finds himself seeking her out just to revel in her fury
He wants to be angry too
He wants to feel something anything other than this hazy numbing fog
It’s making him slow and dumb and useless
He cannot be useless
He follows Carolina into the training room and snipes at her until she snaps at him to either get the hell out or glove up for a sparring match
Tucker is all too happy to glove up and they face off punching kicking tackling grappling
Carolina fights with deadly precision leaving his jaw aching and head swimming without being entirely sure if it was a punch or kick that landed him on his ass
She is careful and so is he and they hit each other just hard enough
It would not do to have either one of them out of commission to be rendered useless
Wash needs them
They cannot be useless
One of Carolina’s punches lands right on the corner of his jaw sending stars spiraling into his eyes and jars his brain loose
A bit of the fog falls away and a red hot something leaches in through the cracks
Tucker tugs at it wraps it around himself like smoke
It isn’t anger not yet but he can mold it and shape it make it hard and unyielding and useful day seventeen
When was the last time you slept
Tucker stops his pacing in the war meeting room to stare at Kimball
Huh
I asked you Kimball says calmly
When was the last time you got some sleep
Uh how the fuck is that any of your goddamn business
Tucker snaps
Across the room he sees Donut clap a palm to his forehead and sigh
What are you my babysitter
No Captain Tucker
I am not your babysitter
I am however the woman who is about to tell you you’re not going on this mission
Like hell I’m not
Tucker pretends he doesn’t see Donut and Ali exchange meaningful eye contact
Are you fucking kidding me right now
Tucker you are in no state to run recon Kimball says firmly
You’re exhausted you’re overworked and you’ve been snapping at everyone
Oh that’s such fucking bullshit
Tucker
Ali glances at Donut again
Look we got this okay
You don’t
Tucker spins to him so fast that the world seems to tilt and it takes a few seconds to register Kimball’s hand on his arm
Get off
Tucker
Kimball yanks on his arm hard forcing him into a chair
Sit
Down
Now
I have to be there he says frantically trying to peer around her to look at Ali
I have to be there
What if you find him and I’m not there
Dude
We’re just running intel this isn’t like a full-scale rescue mission
And we’ll stay on comms the whole time Donut says earnestly
We’ll update you on everything
We might need back-up if shit goes down Ali says
We’ll need you ready
Oh don’t fucking patronize me he glares up at Kimball who blocks his way when he tries to stand
What are you gonna physically restrain me
If I have to
They hold eye contact for a long moment before Tucker turns away with a growl
Fine
Fucking fine go just goddamn go
I’ll sit in the Pelican bay like a good boy
But if I get the slightest hint that you’ve found Wash I’m gonna be out this base so goddamn fast you won’t even see me leave
Got it
We got it Tucker Ali says exasperated and jerks his head at Donut
C’mon Frank let’s go
Don’t fuck this up Tucker snaps at their retreating backs
He pretends he doesn’t see the hurt on Donut’s face day eighteen
The meeting is long and circular and exhausting filled with endless back and forths that lead nowhere
The intel is inconclusive
Charon has been silent
No one has seen Felix or Locus on recent missions
We know nothing
We know nothing
We know nothing
Tucker tunes in and out the words useless all of them until he hears Simmons saying  to consider the possibility that he’s well dead
Tucker sits up in his chair gaze snapping his direction
What did you just say
Simmons casts a nervous glance his way before turning back to Kimball
I mean statistically speaking it’s been over two weeks
Eighteen days Tucker snaps
It’s been eighteen days Simmons
Right Simmons says slowly
So um
Statistically speaking soldiers only withstand torture from an enemy for seven maybe ten
I mean it all depends on the type of torture said soldier is undergoing but we haven’t heard a word
They haven’t asked for ransom or anything
I just
I think we might have to consider
You think we should give up Tucker says staring straight ahead
He cannot look at Simmons
You think we should leave him there with those fucking lunatics
No I don’t
I
I just think we have to be realistic consider that he might be dead
Tucker he might be
STOP LYING
He does not recognize the scream that rips from his mouth
He feels like a stranger in his own body when he shoves away from the table shaking and lunges at Simmons
He wants to punch him to hurt him to yank those filthy lies right out of his mouth
Grif hits like a freight train all power and weight behind his heavy fists
Tucker lands on the ground hard and for several long seconds he can’t see
He lays there dazed rolling blindly to his side and trying to push himself up on weak arms
He hears a clatter much like a chair falling into a floor and Caboose’s voice loud and unhappy
Well that wasn’t very nice
There’s a crash and a thud and a lot of confused yelling and when Tucker finally hauls himself to a sit and shakes the lingering blackness from his eyes it’s to see Donut standing between Grif and Caboose one hand on either of their chests
Stop
Stop
We can’t fight
Stop it
He thinks Wash is dead
Caboose yells
He’s trying to tug Donut’s hand off his chest but Donut has a death grip on the chestplate and Caboose is unsuccessful
He thinks Wash is dead and I don’t think that’s very nice
I do not think people who think Wash is dead should be allowed to go on secret missions where we try to save him or be in secret meetings where we talk about him
I don’t
They think Wash is dead and he is not dead
He is not dead
He is
And then Caboose is crying big gulping sobs
The rest of the room goes dead quiet as he backs away from Donut and falls heavily into a chair burying his face in his hands
C’boose Tucker mutters weakly
He has no idea what the fuck to say he can’t deal with this but his world has contracted to circles and Caboose is on Blue Team and Wash would well Wash wouldn’t know what to say either but he’d say something
Before he can even move Carolina is there standing in front of Caboose
Come on she says firmly
She tugs one of his hands away from his face and pulls him to his feet
Caboose follows her mechanically still sniffling and wiping at his eyes and Tucker watches with his mouth agape as Carolina marches over to the door yanks it open and leaves her hand still wrapped in Caboose’s all the while
Well fuck Tucker mutters
He can’t look at anyone else in the room and settles for picking at the carpet between his knees
He jumps when he feels someone’s hands under his arms and jerks around to see Grif lifting him off the ground
Let’s go asshole Grif snaps
He shoves Tucker towards the door
Taking a leaf out of their book
No more meetings
Go on fucking move it
Tucker obeys with only a little hesitation
He’s half-convinced that Grif is leading him to his death to push him off the base’s wall perhaps but he’s too tired to care
Instead Grif leads him to his room and points at his bed
Sit your ass down
Uh Tucker blinks
So like if you’re thinking we’re gonna have sad I-miss-my-boyfriend sex
Grif pauses from where he’s rummaging in his locker to throw Tucker an unimpressed look
Gross Tucker
No we’re not fucking nice try though in your dreams no we he pulls a bottle filled with amber liquid out of his locker with a flourish are drinking
We shouldn’t Tucker mutters
We shouldn’t be doing doing anything fun not while Wash is being tortured
Oh it’s not gonna be fun Grif says darkly
He takes a swig of the bottle and passes it over to Tucker wiping the back of his hand over his mouth
It’s gonna be shitty and depressing and awful and you’re probably gonna cry but we’re doing it anyway
Drink up
He doesn’t move just stares at the liquid sloshing inside of the bottle
Do you really think Wash is dead
No I don’t Grif says
And neither does Simmons by the way
That’s just how he processes shit
With facts and statistics and numbers
Ya know nerd stuff
It’s a hell of a lot more useful than your constant crying and whining
Tucker stares at the bottle hesitating before taking it from Grif and drinking deep
That’s fucking disgusting he mutters but they drink it anyway and it is shitty and depressing and awful all of it the whiskey and the dark night and the ache inside Tucker’s chest but Grif is there drinking beside him and that’s not so bad and when Simmons pokes his head tentatively into the room two hours later Tucker hands him the bottle and that’s not so bad either
Not so bad at all day nineteen
This is bullshit
Tucker turns from his watch post on Armonia’s wall to see Sarge standing next to him
It’s not your watch Sarge
I make m’own watch
Tucker rolls his eyes and gazes back out over the city before curiosity gets the better of him
What’s bullshit
That I gotta be the temporary leader of Blue Team that’s what
When no further explanation follows Tucker turns to face him fully
Uh who the fuck put you in charge of Blue Team and how did I miss the memo
Washington did
Sarge sniffs
Obviously
Really
Wash put you in charge of Blue Team
Sure did
And when the fuck did this happen
At the crash site Sarge says blithely
He pulled me aside and said he said Sarge
Got a favor to ask of you
Man to man leader to leader
I said alright I suppose we can have ourselves a temporary truce while you make your proposition
Sarge clears his throat
Readjusts his grip on his shotgun
So he said I’ve got a funny feeling about this planet
Something here just don’t sit right with me
Well I couldn’t agree more so I told him to go on
Know what he asked me then
I’m sure you’re about to tell me
He straightened his back and looked me dead in the eye and said in true Agent Melodrama fashion
Sarge if something happens to me I need to know that you’ll look after my men
I know they’re Blues but they’re good people and good soldiers
Caboose can lift up the Warthog in a pinch and Tucker makes the world’s best pancakes and there ain’t no better men a leader could ask for at his back
He didn’t say that Tucker says blinking at Sarge
He didn’t
So Sarge continues loudly
I thought about and I said alright fine Frecklelancer
You do something stupidly heroic and I’ll take care of your boys
I’ve done my fair share of babysitting what’s two more
‘Course then we ended up on the same side of that rock wall so the point was kind of moot but well here we are all these months later and duty calls me to be the interim leader of Blue Team after all
That didn’t happen Tucker says after a beat of silence
That he never asked you to do that
Sarge shrugs
Maybe he did maybe he didn’t
You’ll never know will you
What’s your point
Tucker snaps
M’point is that you need to man up
Stop crying in corners and weeping over your lover’s picture
I’m not weeping over my lover’s picture
Unknot your panties and
This isn’t funny Sarge
Sarge grabs his elbow and yanks him forward until there are mere inches between them
Never said it was he growls
Never said it was
You think I like being the leader of Blue Team
You think I like thinking about what’s happening to Wash
I’ve been around the block a few times son
I know how this works
But you know what else I know
That you running around bitchin’ and moanin’ and yelling at everyone who’s trying to help isn’t going to fix jack shit
I had him Tucker says
His face feels hot and he’s never been more grateful to be wearing his helmet
I
I fucking had him with me and he was we were and now
I know Sarge says
We’ve all had someone with us and then lost ‘em
But you’ve got a chance here
A chance to get
Him
Back
He lets go of Tucker then turning to leave
Don’t fuck it up he says without turning around and then he’s gone red armor fading into the black of night until Tucker can no longer see his shape day twenty
Tucker lies on the floor of Donut’s room and watches the clock staring at the big bubble letters until they begin to lose their meaning
It will be midnight soon and midnight means a new day
Midnight means day twenty-one
Midnight means week three
Week three
It will have been three weeks since Wash had been gone had been taken from them
Tucker promised Caboose that he wouldn’t give up hope but he isn’t even sure what hope looks like anymore
I do believe we have to consider the possibility that they are no longer on the planet Doyle had said glumly that very morning echoing Simmons’ earlier sentiments and Tucker had kicked his chair over on the way out of the room
He is losing it he knows that unraveling piece by piece
This was far far worse than the first time Wash had been missing
Wash was alone now alone and in the hands of Felix and Locus and Tucker was sick with the idea of what they were probably doing to them
If he was even still alive
Soon it would be week three and for the first time day twenty-one
--Tucker wonders if he’ll ever see Wash again
*** The army is listless and silent the next morning all of them going through their training exercises and moving mechanically through the mess hall
Tucker wonders if the rest of them feel it too the mocking ominous pretense of day twenty-one week three wonders if anyone else has counted the days as he has
Wonders if they marked them down on a piece of paper or scratched them into the wall or even the dirt where the wind could sweep the hours away
Tucker has kept time only in his head repeating the days to himself over and over again so that he never forgets never ever forgets that he let Wash down for two days for five for ten for fifteen
For twenty-one
He is only able to stomach half of a ration bar before heading over to the training room to meet Carolina
They have kept up with his sword training both throwing themselves into it with new fervor
Tucker knows that his days of being merely good with his sword are over
He must be better than good
He must be the best if there’s any chance of saving Wash
The training sessions with Carolina are grueling and unforgiving and Tucker looks forward to them each day with vicious pleasure
As the days pass he finds himself seeking out her company more than anyone else’s
Carolina does not tell him to take a break or take it easy and Tucker does not ask for one
He thinks they both need this to push and be pushed
He catches the disapproving glances every time they emerge from the training room hears the whispers that say they need to be careful but he doesn’t want to be careful
He doesn’t deserve to be careful
Today is no different
Carolina is no expert with the sword but she has risen spectacularly to the challenge of an unfamiliar weapon
There are still gaps in his training that Tucker is beginning to accept might never be filled but he has come a long way
Today they don’t speak; they simply run through their katas before moving to sparring with the wooden swords and hand to hand
It feels good
His muscles are sore and singing and it feels wonderful to be training to be getting better
Tucker doesn’t realize that three hours have gone by until he hears a loud TUT of disapproval at the door and turns to see Donut standing just inside the room his arms crossed
Now honestly
Tucker drops his fists and draws a hand across his brow throwing an agitated glance Donut’s way
What
Donut has his helmet tucked under his arm so Tucker can see every frown line and disapproving glare
You know what
No I don’t Tucker snaps so unless you’re here with some useful information
Donut swells at that actually swells his chest puffing up and his arms drawing back
Don’t you take that tone with me Lavernius Tucker
Tucker snatches a towel off the bench and scrubs it over his face taking a deep breath and trying to quell his temper
It’s too close to the surface these days bubbling just out of sight
He’s already had it out with every other member of Red Team and really doesn’t want to add Donut to the list
I’m not taking a tone
I just want to know what you’re doing here
And I want to know where you two get off running yourselves into the ground like this
Tucker glances at Carolina who has suddenly wiped her expression clean
No help from that corner apparently
I’m not we’re just training Donut
Donut’s glaring intensifies
Oh reeeeally
When was the last time you ate
I had breakfast before I came in here
Half a ration bar is not breakfast Tucker
Dude are you spying on me
Donut sniffs folding his arms across his chest
I have it on good authority that neither one of you has been eating properly
So you’re having other people spy on me Tucker interrupts
Wonderful
Fantastic
We don’t need you babying us you know
Wash wouldn’t want you to be pushing yourselves like this Donut says and Tucker blinks hard
He wasn’t expecting him to go in for the kill so quickly but Donut continues stepping into the room
Wash would want to know that you’re taking care of yourselves that we’re all taking care of each other
The blood is starting to thud dangerously in Tucker’s ears now and he’s rapidly forgetting his promise to not yell at Donut
Well we don’t actually know what he’d want now do we he says loudly
Considering he’s not here and all
I know Donut says
Unlike Tucker’s his voice is getting quieter and quieter
I know he’d want that
Know what I think he’d want
For us to come and get him
Which we’ll do Donut says firmly but we can’t if two of our strongest fighters are collapsing from malnutrition and sleep deprivation
Tucker rolls his eyes
Okay let’s not get melodramatic
Donut fishes two ration bars out of his pocket and brandishes them at Carolina and Tucker in a threatening sort of way
I’m not hungry Carolina says
She says it automatically as if she’s had this conversation a million times before
Which Tucker realizes she probably has
And you Donut huffs
You didn’t eat anything this morning and your hair looks simply atrocious
It’s fine Carolina says in that same automatic tone
I’m fine
And so is myhair
Don’t think that I haven’t noticed you aren’t using that Powerful Pixie Pomade I got you you know it wasn’t exactly a walk in the park getting that stuff on the last supply run
Donut look we’re not hungry
Tucker tosses his hand towel back onto the bench
Man you don’t understand
SHUT UP
Tucker jumps
He jumps because Donut yelled at him raised his voice and yelled and when Donut gets into his face and shoves him Tucker’s jaw nearly drops to the floor
Shut up shut up shut up
Carolina has dropped her politely disinterested expression as she looks between the two of them aghast
Donut
You shut up too
Donut yells
I’m so sick of the pair of you
Running around like you’re the only two who care about Wash
We never said that Tucker says weakly
We never
Don’t tell me I don’t understand
Wash is my friend too my friend mine
I know he’s your lover butbut Donut struggles for a moment before his stony façade crumples replaced by a hopeless devastation
You aren’t the only one whose lover is gone
His words hit Tucker hard and a glance at Carolina’s face shows him that she feels similarly
Tucker is just opening his mouth to say something anything when Epsilon pop up on top of Carolina’s nearby helmet glaring at Tucker
Nice going asshole
Shut up Epsilon Tucker snaps
Donutlook I But Donut is turning away wiping hastily at his eyes and fumbling for the door
Tucker makes to follow him but somewhere in the middle of his first step between his foot lifting off and landing everything changes
Static
There is so much static and Tucker reaches automatically for the dial on his radio before he remembers that he isn’t wearing his helmet
Carolina makes a similar gesture meeting Tucker’s bewildered eyes
Oh my goodness Donut says weakly Tucker turns to see his gaze directed somewhere over their heads
Look
He follows Donut’s gaze to the television monitor hanging in the corner of the gym
Up until now Tucker hadn’t even realized that it worked and he’d all but forgotten it was there
The rest of the gym’s inhabitants are already clustered around it looking up at the monitor in horror
Because Felix is on the screen
He isn’t saying anything just standing there with his arms folded across his chest waiting for something apparently
The silence sits until the tension in the room is so thick that Tucker thinks he could probably cut it with his sword
Felix huffs a little glancing somewhere to his left
Is this fucking thing even on well why didn’t you say so
Good God
Felix straightens the lines of his body sharpening as he looks back at the camera
Hey there Armonia
I hope you’re all enjoying this lovely weather we’ve had recently it’s great isn’t it
Chorus just just shines in the autumn if you ask me
Anyway
I’m sure you’re all want to know how Agent Washington is doing so let’s cut right to the chase shall we
You know I’ve been hearing a lot of rumors lately and I gotta say it saddened me to hear that you’d given your buddy up for dead
Frankly I thought we’d have to thwart at least one shitty rescue mission attempt but well once losers always losers am I right
Felix laughs careless
I couldn’t help but feel a bit sorry for you so I just wanted to let you know that Agent Washington isn’t dead
Uh oh Epsilon mutters
This is not good Carolina we
Felix steps aside and Epsilon stops talking and everyone in the room gasps because there finally finally is Wash
Tucker feels a relief so powerful that it nearly knocks him right off his feet
Wash Wash Wash
Wash is there and he is alive and Tucker takes a moment to revel in the feeling light-headed and loopy with relief and joy and hope
The relief doesn’t go away but it is shoved into the background as Tucker looks at Wash
He looks bad
Really bad
Wash is bound to a chair hands drawn behind his back and he has a piece of duct tape over his mouth duct tape like it’s 1995 and they’re in a fucking superhero movie or something
It’s wrong all wrong because if anyone is the hero here it’s supposed to be Wash not him
He’s gotten used to that word recently hero after Freelancer after the Tower but he’s never needed to be a hero as badly as he does now and he doesn’t know if he’s up for it
Wash looks so tired
Tucker notices that first that Wash looks exhausted down to his very core before the other details register the blood the bruises the vicious handprints on Wash’s neck
There’s blood all over the front of his scrub top and a deep cut right across his cheekbone and he has some serious scruff going on
Wash shaved every single morning after his morning run and before breakfast and Tucker’s never seen him with stubble let alone scruff
So
Felix claps his hands brightly and Tucker’s eyes snap back to him
As you can see Agent Washington is very much alive and well I wouldn’t say well but we haven’t broken him into too many pieces just yet have we Wash
He rests his forearm on Wash’s shoulder leaning casually into his space and Tucker clenches his hands into tight fists at his sides the nails cutting into his palms
Don’t touch him he snarls under his breath
Don’t fucking touch him
What do you say we put on a little show for Armonia here while we break off a few more
Carolina Epsilon says weakly
I think the whole base is getting this video
Tucker hadn’t noticed at first but he can hear it now the echo in both Felix’s words and the static projecting from God knows how many monitors
Everyone’s gonna see it Epsilon continues
We have to lock it down
They all suck in a breath as Felix pushes himself back to a stand shakes out his wrists and backhands Wash so hard that his head snaps to the side
No
The cry escapes him before he can stop it and Tucker lunges at the television as if moving closer to the image will actually bring him closer to Wash
Wash
C we have to go now
Tucker sees Carolina startle out of the corner of his eye
Right
NO
Tucker yells it again lunging at Epsilon this time not taking his eyes off the monitor
No don’t turn it off don’t you can’t
I didn’t say turn it off I said lock it down look
C
I’m going to centralize this to the monitor in the meeting room I’ll meet you there
Epsilon winks away and Carolina grabs his arm yanking him around
Tucker come on
Wh
Tucker stretches his neck to glimpse the monitor in time to see Felix crack Wash across the jaw again
No no I don’t want to leave him I can’t leave him
Carolina spins him around and shakes him hard
Tucker
Pull it together
We have to localize the signal
Tucker the whole base is going to see this everyone
Everyone
Tucker breaks into a run next to her as they clear the room Donut hot on their heels
There’s a thundering noise behind them and when Tucker glances back he sees the entire training room follow them as well
Wait we’re coming too
Andersmith yells but Carolina just tightens her grip on Tucker’s arm and quickens their pace They catch glimpses of television screens as they run the sounds of Felix’s voice and latent static echoing in Tucker’s ears
The screens in the hallway go black all at once and Tucker skids to a halt horrified
Wait
Bring it back bring it back
Tucker in here
Carolina yanks him around a final corner hauls him and Donut into the war meeting room and slams the door in the face of what looks like half the fucking army
Kimball and Doyle are both in the room as well as Sarge but it’s empty otherwise or at least Tucker thinks so
A sickened sort of relief sweeps through him as he looks at the huge monitor to see Wash and Felix still there
The image is much crisper and clearer now and Tucker’s eyes roam over Wash taking in every detail committing it to memory
He’s lost weight a lot of weight and there’s a stain on his scrub pants that Tucker suspects is urine probably because they’d had him that fucking chair for God knows how long
His one eye is blackened and the handprints on his neck were clearly made by someone wearing gloves
Tucker looks into his eyes the longest
They are exhausted and haunted but he can see Wash in them burning bright and fierce
He’s in there
Despite it all he’s still in there
I locked it down Epsilon is saying quickly to Kimball projecting himself using one of the smaller monitors
He moves automatically to Carolina’s shoulder
Locked it up no one else can see it now but us
Felix’s next strike lands on Wash’s ribs and Wash curls in on himself letting out a little oof of pain
The sound echoes on and on in Tucker’s ears as if he’d screamed it
Wash
Wash it’s okay we’re coming we’re coming for you he half turns to Epsilon desperately
Can he hear us
Can we get a mic
I’m working on it Epsilon mutters
I’m
They all stop talking as Felix pulls out a knife spinning it thoughtfully in his hands and turning it to the camera
What do you say we make this a little more interesting hmm Wash
Felix grabs Wash by the hair yanking his head up and putting the knife to his throat
For one sickening heart stopping moment Tucker is sure that he's going to kill Wash right then and there and he lunges at the monitor before he can stop himself
So many options Felix says
His voice is thoughtful as he absentmindedly flips the knife so that the flat of the blade is against Wash’s skin and drags it down his neck across the bruises and over the pulse of his throat and down to his collarbone and that’s a fucking hickey on Wash’s neck
Tucker moves closer to the monitor still barely registering the frantic protests of everyone else in the room as he blocks their view
A hickey
He knows it
He’s left enough marks on Wash’s skin himself to know how easy it is to raise a mark to know exactly what shade of purple it would be depending on how long he sucked to know just how much pressure to apply to get Wash to shudder
Carolina yanks him impatiently away from the monitor and Tucker lets her his eyes locked onto the screen
He can practically feel Felix’s fucking smirk from all the way over here
Oh you asshole he breathes
You motherfucking
You know I think I want to play around a little more with that cut from earlier but
I can’t really see what I’m doing here Felix says
He wraps his hand around the collar of Wash’s shirt and yanks hard the fabric tearing down to his navel
Tucker can really see it now the muscle and weight that Wash has lost
There’s a light bruising around his ribs and a long cut that reaches from his collar to the bottom of his sternum
Felix takes the knife and digs it into the cut deeper this time and reopens the wound until the blood is blossoming over the blade
Carolina’s fingers tighten on Tucker’s arm to the point of pain but he doesn’t move away doesn’t give a single inclination that the motion hurt
What do they want Kimball murmurs her gaze fixed on the screen
What do they wantEpsilon
I said I’m working on it Epsilon says tightly
Felix draws the knife through the same cut again and Tucker winces
Wash’s eyes are narrowed his gaze directed determinedly forward
Some distant corner of his brain registers his admiration that Wash isn’t making a single noise
Tucker knows he’d be yelling his head off
That’s gonna need stitches Sarge says gruffly from his corner of the room
Deep cut
He’s right
The blood is flowing from the wound at an alarming rate and Tucker’s heart pounds in his ears
They wouldn’t kill him he tells himself
They wouldn’t have kept him alive all this time just to kill him now
Felix pauses leaning over Wash’s shoulder to examine the cut
Donut spins away from the screen burying his face in his hands as Felix digs his fingers into the wound and Wash makes a small hurt noise
I think that’ll do he says casually
Definitely going to scar
Had to give you something to remember me by
Move it along Felix
Wash’s eyes flick up to somewhere over the camera as Locus’s voice comes slightly impatient
Right right down to business Felix says
He straightens leaning an elbow on Wash’s shoulder once more
Anyway
We made an interesting little discovery while Wash here has been our esteemed guest
Would you like to guess what we discovered
" He pauses as if waiting for an answer and Kimball turns once more to Epsilon
Epsilon can we get a mic
It’s not live Epsilon says
He sounds a little stunned
I this isn’t a live feed
It’s a recording
A recording
But why
"What we discovered" Felix continues "is that Washington gets a little flinchy when you get too close to his implants
It's pretty neat actually
Wanna see
"  He takes the knife and drags it across the back of Wash’s neck
Wash jerks in surprise a muffled noise of pain escaping as he twists away from the blade
Felix reverses the knife slamming the butt of it into the back of Wash's neck
Wash sort of gasps and retches his head sagging momentarily almost to his knees before he wrenches it back up curving back as if to protect his implants
Tucker knows that look that sort of chin-lifted-shoulders-raised thing that Wash does when he's feeling vulnerable or when he doesn't have his back to a wall
At first Tucker thought it was some typical Freelancer stuff- watch your six never present your back to the enemy that type of thing
It took him awhile to realize that this was more than just a Freelancer thing; it was a Washington thing and Washington hated anyone touching his implants hated exposing the back of his neck to anyone he didn't trust
Wash was best in a fight when he knew he had a wall or a teammate at his back and he and Tucker had somehow started fighting this way back to back covering each other
They made a good team
But now Wash is doing his chin-lifted-shoulders-raised thing and Tucker's not there to press their backs together and Felix hits him again square on his implantation site and Wash goes down again and takes much longer to drag himself back up this time
He hears Epsilon curse next to him as they get a good look at the blood all over the back of Wash's neck
Felix trails a hand through Wash’s hair almost lovingly before his grip tightens on the strands
He holds out his other hand
Toss me the lighter would you Locus
Oh shit Epsilon says while Carolina’s grip tightens around Tucker’s arm once more
Ohhhh shit Felix catches the lighter easily igniting it just in front of Wash’s face
Wash’s eyes flick momentarily to the flame before refocusing on the camera and narrowing determinedly and Tucker swears that Wash is looking right at him
You’re sure he can’t see us
Tucker asks
His heart is pounding in his throat and the words come out as a whisper
You’re sure
He looks like he can see us
I’m sure Epsilon says sounding no less agonized about it
It’s this recording is days old
Days
Tucker stops talking as Felix brings the lighter around to the back of Wash’s neck and holds it there directly over his implants
He can’t quite see what’s happening but Wash thrashes hard twisting his head out of Felix’s grip
Felix grabs his hair again jerking Wash back
Wash Wash Wash
Stay where the fuck I put you got it
He holds Wash fast and runs the flame over the back of his neck once more
The noise of protest that Wash makes as he jerks in pain cuts through Tucker like a knife and then the noise of protest turns into a muffled scream and Tucker thinks he’s going to be sick
Donut still hasn’t turned back to the screen a whimper punching out of him as Wash screams again through the tape
Tucker takes his free hand he’s got his other wrapped tightly into the hem of Carolina’s shirt and isn’t quite sure when that happened and pats at Donut’s arm
Don’t listen he says voice weak
Donut don’t don’t listen
I’ll listen
I can do it
Donut curls his hands over his ears and Tucker keeps a hand on his elbow
He notices for the first time that Sarge has made his way over to their corner of the room and is patting Donut’s other shoulder and saying No shame son no shame in not being able to watch
Sarge lets out an exasperated huff as Donut clutches onto his arm and press his ear into the hard plates of Sarge’s shoulder guards and the four of them stand there holding onto each other and watching the screen watching Wash
Felix finally closes the lighter after what seems like an eternity and hits Wash across the temple a final time and this time when Wash sags down he does not lift himself back up
So anyway Felix says
He picks up his discarded knife and wipes it off in Wash’s hair and Tucker feels himself go lightheaded with fury
I just just thought I’d give you guys a little hope y’know
As you can see Agent Washington isn’t dead
I’ll make sure you know when that happens because I mean that is going to happen
I just wouldn’t want you to get the date wrong on his death certificate
The video cuts out so abruptly that it leaves Tucker’s head reeling
He lets out a shaky breath uncurling his fingers from Carolina’s shirt
Holy shit he says weakly
Ho ly shit
You’re telling me Epsilon says
Alright let me see if I can get some kind of lock on where that signal was transmitted from
Something tugs at Tucker’s memory and he turns to Epsilon with a frown
Did you say this was recorded days ago
Two at least Epsilon says absently
It must have taken them a hot second to get it through my firewalls
What firewalls
Epsilon isn’t the only one who turns to look at him then
Kimball and Doyle have both stopped arguing long enough to turn his way and Carolina is also looking at him warily
What
Firewalls
Tucker asks again trying to keep his temper under control but he can already feel it slipping away
What firewalls hmmm let me see the fucking firewalls I have up to prevent the enemy from hacking into our shit
The firewalls that protect our data and
And prevents incoming transmissions
Exactly
Incoming transmissions just like this one
Tucker
You didn’t think to account for this possibility
Tucker snaps waving a hand angrily at the screen
What the possibility that we’d get a fucking video memo
Yes
Exactly that
Of course they’d tried to send us blackmail torture tapes
It’s Felix
Jesus Christ Epsilon
Alright Kimball says sharply That’s enough
Yeah Tucker says
Yeah
You’re goddamn right it’s enough
Excuse me excuse me
Doctor coming through
They falter as the unmistakable voice of Dr Grey filters through
Tucker is just marveling at how her voice manages to carry above the rest of the crowd when a pounding starts on the door somehow more insistent than the others
Excuse me
Let me in please
Doyle casts his gaze heavenward
Emily now is not the time
I have vital information Donald
It most certainly is the time
Tucker moves towards the door to let her in but Doyle sputters his protest
Half the army’s out there
You can’t let her in here
She says she has information
Which could mean anything
Information about Washington you idiots
Tucker moves again but Sarge is faster
He crosses the room in three steps opens the door and bodily lifts Dr Grey out of the crowd
They have just enough time to catch sight of several furious faces before Sarge slams the door shut again
Alright he says setting Dr Grey down
Let’s have a listen to what the good lady has to say
Thank you Dr Grey says
She smooths her hands over her lab coat adjusts her glasses and looks around at them all
I know where Wash is
Silence
You do
Really
Tucker asks finally
His voice comes far more vulnerable and small than he intended but the only acknowledgement is a soft something in Dr Grey’s eyes as she turns to look at him
I do
Really
How
Kimball asks at the same time Carolina says Where
They’re keeping him at the central hospital in Imphonia Dr Grey says
I did my residency there
Spent more time than you can imagine staring at those horrible peach walls
Atrocious Donut mutters and Dr Grey nods vigorously
Great Tucker says
So how far is it
Should we take a Pelican or what
He stares impatiently at Doyle who has begun shaking his head so hard Tucker thinks it’s in danger of flying off his neck
We can’t just march into Imphonia
Why not
Sarge asks
My good sir that city has been abandoned for
Years Kimball supplies
Years
It’s a minefield
Quite literally Doyle says
The ground is riddled with undetonated grenades and pressure mines and
Look Tucker says temper rising I don’t care if it’s guarded by the fucking devil himself that’s where Dr Grey says he is and
Where Dr Grey thinks he is Kimball cuts in
Excuse me Dr Grey says the slightest bit of frost creeping into her cheery tone
Imphonia was my home for over a decade
I lived in that hospital
Wash is there I’m sure of it
There are plenty of buildings on this planet with peach walls Kimball says through gritted teeth
What makes you
It wasn’t just the walls Dr Grey says
The lights they make this sort of high-pitched whine like a They all wince as she lets out a loud trill
I didn’t hear a noise like that Carolina says doubtfully
I did
Donut pipes up
She’s right there was that sound
Play the video again Dr Grey says
It was right at the beginning
Kimball hesitates but heads over to the monitor presses a few buttons until Felix’s image appears once more
There’s the peach Dr Grey murmurs
Awful color the noise was right before it cuts out

They watch in silence none of them able to look away until Dr Grey jumps
There
Did you hear it
Everyone shakes their heads except Donut and Dr Grey rewinds the video
Right after he straightens This time Tucker hears it the tiny trilling of the lights in the background
Now that he’s heard it it’s impossible to miss as it sounds again twenty seconds later
That is a pretty distinctive sound he says
Tucker you’re reaching Kimball says impatiently
Did you hear it
Dr Grey asks absently
She’s got her datapad out and is taking notes eyes never straying from the screen
I yes I heard it but that proves nothing Emily
I can’t watch this again Donut says moving towards the monitor as Felix pulls his knife out but Emily catches his hand
Wait
I need to keep track of his injuries
For when we bring him home
Everyone falls silent at that and Tucker glances at her datapad to see the notes malnutrition possible cracked ribs possible fractured skull severe sleep deprivation
She says nothing as she watches just takes her notes her pen only faltering when Wash sags over his knees the back of his neck exposed
There’s a loud snap as the tablet pen breaks in her hands
Sarge hands her another one without word
Right she says when the video is finally over
She swivels to face Kimball and Doyle smoothing her hands over her lap and clasping her hands around the datapad
Generals it is of the utmost importance that we find Agent Washington immediately
He is in terrible shape
Kimball throws up her hands
No one is saying that he isn’t
Did you see the wound on his stomach
Did you
She glances between the two of them and when she gets no answer
That was from a feeding tube
A feeding tube
Donut says horrified
But why would they I don’t know Dr Grey says calmly
The only reason that you would hook someone up to a feeding tube is if they were unable to feed themselves
If they were for example in a coma
He wasn’t hurt badly enough to be in a coma Tucker says glancing around the room uneasily
I mean not when we last saw him
He was shot in the leg but He trails off thinking of Wash unconscious and slung over Locus’s shoulders
There had been blood all over his hair bright and fresh and visible even from Tucker’s distance
I don’t think he fell into a coma from his injuries Dr Grey says and Tucker is relieved before realizing that there’s nothing reassuring about her tone
Then why would he have a scar from a feeding tube if he wasn’t in a coma
Carolina asks frowning
Oh I’m almost certain he was in one Dr Grey says grimly
But I Silence follows her words before Sarge finally speaks
Go on Emily
Just tell us
For some reason it knocks the goddamn wind out of him Sarge saying her name like that
Go on Emily
Tucker recognizes that tone the soft yet firm reassuring cadence that one’s voice fell into when someone they loved was dancing around an important topic
He’s used it himself with Wash many times
Tucker misses him so much that it aches
Emily looks at Sarge and nods firmly setting her datapad aside and folding her hands atop her crossed legs
I believe that his coma was medically induced she says once again business-like
I believe they’re doing something to the wires in his brain
His implants Epsilon says suddenly
You think they’re fucking with his implants
I do
Dr Grey picks up the remote and rewinds the video until the part where Wash bows his head to his knees pausing it there
His implantation site is swollen
I really don’t like the fact that there was fire so close to those wires either there’s a very real chance something could’ve melted right onto his brain
It it could just be swollen from the torture Tucker croaks shoving the horrific thought of wires melting into Wash’s brain aside
It could right
Dr Grey shakes her head hopping off the desk and moving closer to the screen
You see here
That’s a surgical scar
They widened the ports to expose the wires
I had to do it myself when I operated on him
But why
Carolina asks
Why are they going through all this trouble
They’re trying to get us to do something rash
They all turn to face Kimball who is watching them all with her arms folded
They didn’t make a single demand
They didn’t ask Wash a single question
They didn’t even give us a clue as to where he was
His wounds they were all fresh couldn’t have been more than a day old
They knocked him around so that he would look terrible for that video
Which proves my point Dr Grey pipes up
She continues undaunted when Kimball glares at her
If those wounds were all fresh then what were they doing beforehand
Now I’m no soldier but it seems to me that one doesn’t spend three weeks with the enemy and remain unscathed
She’s got a point Carolina says
It’s ridiculous
So the question is what have they been doing all this time
Dr Grey raises her hand ticking the evidence off on her fingers
He has a scar from a feeding tube
They’ve probably criss-crossed his implants every which way
He’s lost a significant amount of weight
II think that whatever tortures he’s undergone they’ve been far morepsychological than physical
The break in her voice is so slight that Tucker almost misses it
She covers it quickly the dark of her eyes turning to steel as she looks between Kimball and Doyle
Tucker’s right
We need to go get him
And we will Doyle says slowly
But But we have to be smart about it
Kimball says and Doyle nods vigorously
Great
Of all the fucking times for the two of them to agree on something
The sole purpose of that video was to goad us into going to rescue him
Well good for them it worked
Tucker rakes his hands through his dreads
Are you actually fucking saying we shouldn’t go
Did we watch the same goddamn video
That’s not what I’m saying
Kimball takes a breath
What I’m saying is that we can’t go charging off recklessly because that’s what they want
What I’m saying is that we need more intel
What I’m saying isthat this mission will be strictly volunteer only
Fucking great Tucker says
I volunteer
Me too Carolina says as Donut nods over her shoulder
Count me in
Sarge says
It’s too goddamn tiring trying to lead Blue Team and Red Team
A man can only take so much
Dr Grey pats her datapad
I’ll be ready
She glances from Sarge to Carolina to Donut to Tucker
You bring him home now
We will Tucker says
I swear to fucking God we will day twenty-two twenty-three four three twenty-three
Tucker’s life has been reduced to numbers the kind that won’t stay still
Eighty-five twenty-two thirty-three
Day twenty-one week three
Twenty-two (--three twenty-four twenty-five not yet not yet--) This day started out with numbers too
Twenty volunteers
There were more so many more and Tucker wanted so badly for Wash to be able to see it to see so many people lining up for him fighting for the chance to try to save him
But Kimball put her foot down and so they were twenty
Ten hours to Imphonia
Two hours to stake the place out
Those were the good numbers
Tucker grits his teeth and closes his eyes outside the infirmary
If he keeps them closed and focuses hard on the numbers he can almost block out the sounds around him
Closing his eyes helps little but he can’t ignore the bad numbers
Ten blocks into the city
Twelve mines
Three snipers
Six grenades
Tucker exhales slowly and lets his head fall back
Nine dead
Three critical
Two lost limbs
And thirty minutes
Thirty minutes of hell until they’d been forced out
Kimball is storming down the hall to him to them and he knows that in any other circumstance he’d be terrified but now he’s just counting down the steps until she’s in front of them
Six five four three two

What
Happened
Tucker knows what she’s really asking
Kimball already knew what happened had been debriefed on that awful Pelican ride back (two more deaths on the Pelican Tucker had vomited in the corner until there was nothing left in his stomach and he wasn’t the only one--) She knew about the loss of life and limb and the horrible failure they’d suffered
She wasn’t asking what happened
She was asking how they let it
There’s a lump in Tucker’s throat that he cannot speak around so he doesn’t try just shakes his head and stares at his clasped hands
When Kimball speaks again her voice is full of anguish
I told you we needed more time
I told you that whole city was a death trap I told you we weren’t ready
She isn’t even looking at Tucker but he knows that the brunt of her rage is directed at him
He can’t blame her
Seven out of the nine had been New Republic cadets
Her cadets
We’ll do better Tucker manages his voice barely above a whisper
Next time
We’ll we’ll do better
Next time
Tucker glances up and their eyes lock
Kimball has her helmet tucked under her arm her dark hair pulled back into a tight bun
The lines of her face are sharply accented brown eyes full of anger and grief
He’s never seen her look more like a leader than she does now
I won’t fuck it up again Tucker says hoarsely
I won’t we’ll do better we can do this I can do this
You misunderstand me she says
There isn’t going to be a next time
What
Half the hallway has fallen silent at their words and Tucker isn’t sure why
The two of them aren’t yelling or at least he thinks they aren’t
He can’t quite be sure
You heard me she says voice sharp and sure
There isn’t going to be a next time
I won’t risk the lives of my soldiers for another suicide mission after we’ve already lost so many
Kimball Tucker says struggling to keep his voice calm
We have to go for him
We don’t even know for sure that’s where he is
I know
They turn to see Dr Grey in the doorway of the infirmary brushing several stray curls out of her eyes with her forearm
Andersmith’s alive she says
We’ll need to keep an extra-close eye on him but he’s stable
Ohhhhh good that’s good Caboose mutters slumping in relief on the bench next to him
Good
That’sthat’s very good
Kimball has a hand pressed absent-mindedly to her chest her shoulders sagging slightly in relief
He’s alive
He is
Dr Grey pulls her scrub cap off and stuffs it in her pocket shaking out her curls
For a few moments the hallway is silent all of them reveling in relief
Tucker waits holding his breath
She didn’t mean it he tells himself even as he knows it isn’t true
She didn’t mean
We cannot afford another catastrophe like this Captain Tucker Kimball says quietly
We are stretched too thin as it is and we can’t afford to lose any more lives
But we can afford to lose Wash
He keeps his voice light and controlled but catches Grif and Simmons exchanging a glance out of the corner of his eye anyway
When she speaks again her voice is oddly flat and blank
That’s not what I’m saying
It is though
Tucker pushes off the bench suddenly unable to sit still
You’re saying that we should just leave him there in that fucking hellhole
We don’t even know he’s there
Dr Grey speaks up again
Wash is in that city General Kimball
I’m sure of it
You’re not Kimball says
You saw the color of the walls and heard a beeping sound that
A trilling sound
That you could hear anywhere did you know that I have a photographic memory
I’m not sending more of my soldiers to die based on your memory
We need good hard intelligence and even then
What are you saying
Tucker says loudly
He clutches his helmet tightly in his hands and tries to focus to breathe
Just fucking tell me what you’re saying
I’m saying that it’s over Kimball says sharply
I’m saying no more
No more
The hallway erupts at her words and Tucker can make out only bits and pieces of the conversations
Britton’s But General Kimball you can’t wails high above the crowd and Kimball gives her head a firm shake
I won’t leave him there Tucker says
He can feel himself shaking
If you think I’m going to fucking sit here and wait until you give the okay
I don’t Kimball says
I don’t expect that at all
You’re done
And what the fuck does that mean
It means that you’re no longer a Captain in this army Tucker
Not like this
You are unfocused and reckless
THEY’RE TORTURING HIM
His helmet is at the opposite end of the hallway and Tucker has no memory of it leaving his hands
They’re shaking trembling at his sides and he clenches them into tight fists
They’re torturing him he says again
For weeks for three weeks and you standing there telling me I’m unfocused
What the fuck else am I supposed to focus on
He’s
I have to
Tucker someone whispers but Tucker doesn’t know who and he doesn’t care
I’m going to get him Tucker says
I don’t care how many fucking tries it takes I’m going
I won’t leave him there
Then go Kimball says
I wish you all the luck in the world
Take a Pelican take some of our supplies and go
If you find him you will always have a place here but until that dayyou’re done
She stops glancing around at the hallway
Everyone is silent watching and waiting and her eyes turn to steel
When she looks back at Tucker they are shuttered
I will not risk the lives of this entire army for one man
Something settles in Tucker’s chest at those words a deep quiet calm where before there was nothing but pain and rage and guilt
He nods at her once hard and turns on his heel to retrieve his helmet
When he reaches the end of the hallway Caboose is already holding it out to him
They turn as one
They don’t say a word as they make their way to Blue Team’s hallway to grab Caboose’s things then to Red Team’s hallway so Tucker can grab some stuff from his drawer in Donut’s room
They make the rounds to the armory to get some extra weapons to the mess hall for some ration bars to the infirmary to check in on the survivors
The room is quiet and still filled only with beeps and buzzes and the hushed whispers of the loved ones holding vigil
Tucker walks past every bed fingers brushing against the frames trying not to let the feelings of guilt and shame suffocate him
There had been a moment in the earliest days of Wash’s captivity when he’d advocated for only himself and the other sim troopers and Carolina to go for Wash
The sentiment had been vehemently opposed from both sides Feds and News alike
This isn’t like before Jensen had told him eyes huge behind her glasses
We’re ready this time we are
Wash is our friend too Ali had added
And so are you
Stop being so weird about this
Tucker had relented
He knew deep down that they couldn’t save Wash alone and like it or not they were all a part of this army now
But looking around at the wounded at his friends so still and silent he can’t help feeling that he and the others should have left before any of this had happened
Tucker lingers at Ali’s bed his stomach swooping sickeningly at the sight of his arm severed just above the elbow
There’d been an explosion and he’d been trapped his arm stuck under a gigantic cement pillar that wouldn’t budge no matter how many people tried to lift it
It had been awful every part of it the screaming the slow realization of what had to happen the anguish in Ali’s voice as he’d looked square at Tucker and told him to just cut it off already
The smell of burning flesh as Tucker’s sword had cut so neatly through the armor and skin and bone
I’m sorry Tucker whispers and although Ali does not stir Perry does lifting his head up from where it was resting against the edge of the mattress
Are you leaving he asks tiredly as if he’d expected it and Tucker nods
Perry glances at where Patil is asleep in a chair on the other side of Ali’s mattress then at Ali himself before holding something out to Tucker
Here
Tucker glances down to see a pair of dog tags the dull silver standing out sharply against Perry’s dark skin
Fitz’s dog tags
Dude I can’t fucking take those
I’ll be expecting them back when you bring Wash home Perry says
He shoves them into Tucker’s hand insistently
For luck
I’d come with you but He looks again at Ali and Tucker nods
I know
Don’t you don’t have to explain
I know
They bump fists and Tucker turns to where Caboose is waiting for him in the infirmary doorway
They still do not say a word as they go to the Pelican bay Tucker stops short when he sees every last one of the Reds standing there Donut and Sarge and Grif and Simmons and even Lopez
Carolina’s there too conversing with them in low tones Epsilon close to her side
What the fuck
Look Grif says
Let’s just skip over the part where we have a moment and get our asses in the Pelican shall we
Everybody good with that
That work for everyone
There’s a brief awkward pause before they turn to get on the ship
Tucker thinks he should say something but he’s only ever been good at scraping words up off the ground and for this they could never be enough
Grif takes the Pelican out of the base and in moments they’re high above Armonia
Tucker does not look back
Well Sarge says settling back comfortably in his chair
Guess it’s high time for
He sits back up suddenly one hand going to his helmet
Whoa hold on there lil’ lady he pops the seals on his helmet and sets it on the ground
Go on tell the others
I know how you can get to Wash
Dr Grey’s voice bubbles over the radio and Tucker’s heart skips a beat
Wait really
I just don’t know why I didn’t think of it before
Dr Grey pauses
Well I did I just didn’t think it would work but then I remembered in my sophomore year when I was running late to class
I had a super huge test that day and I had to scurry well anyway
I have a genius plan
Which is
Tucker asks urgently his heart pounding
Right
Dr Grey clears her throat
We can’t avoid those land mines and snipers there’s just no way for you to go around them
Dr Grey pauses and they all lean in closer to Sarge’s helmets desperate not to miss her next words
Tucker is holding his breath everything in him hoping hoping hoping
But you can go under them
Captivity is so very cold
The cold and the discomfort it brings have been at the forefront of Wash’s mind ever since he fought his way back to lucidity
It impossible to ignore; the pain and stress and confusion somehow seem secondary to the all-encompassing chill that sucks the warmth straight from his body
It had been cold in that hospital room Wash reflects although it wasn’t so much unbearable as it was annoying
He’d been more focused on separating memory from lie and the cold had eventually given up on clamoring for his attention and settled into a background buzz
Now though lying on the cold cement of the floor the cold is unbearable
It’s pretty anticlimatic Wash thinks dully
After all that he’s been through in the last several weeks in the last several years really his death should have been the result of crippling insanity or brutal torture or perhaps a daring escape attempt
He shouldn’t go out like this shivering so hard he can barely see
Surely the universe owes him that much
Wash can’t remember how long he’s been here
He has fuzzy memories of being uncuffed from that chair and half-dragged half-carried to this basement room and dropped on the floor
He remembers coming to with his cheek pressed into the cement and an alarming amount of blood pooling beneath his chest and he’d forced himself to sit and bind the wound on his chest with the tattered remains of his scrub top and a good portion of his right pant leg
The bleeding had eventually stopped although Wash doesn’t remember when
They haven’t left him there to die there’s an MRE shoved through his door every morning and Wash devours it stomach howling limbs shaking with exhaustion and hunger
It isn’t clear why the change from hospital beds to a cell was so abrupt but Wash suspects that a part of them gave up the illusions once they realized their lies weren’t taking
Or rather he wants to suspect that
Somehow Wash doesn’t believe it’s going to be quite that easy
They have another ace up their sleeve Wash thinks although he has no idea what it could possibly be
Wash had been half-conscious for most of that video recording but he knew that Felix and Locus hadn’t asked a single question or made a single demand from Armonia
The whole thing as much as Wash hates to admit it was a bait
He also hates to admit that it probably worked
The largest part of him wants his team to stay where they are safe and secure behind the walls of Armonia
Deep down he knows it’s a fool’s hope
Wash has seen enough of the Reds and Blues’ ad hoc missions to know exactly what they’d do in a situation like this one
Perhaps it’ll work he thinks to himself before the larger part of his brain furiously dismisses this thought
It’d be a waste such a waste if they came to rescue him
With the days dragging on as they are it just seems unlikely that he’ll last that long
Lame way to go Wash thinks again as another violent shudder wracks his body
He presses his back to the wall and warps his arms around himself
His body is slick with sweat as he curls in on himself and he glances down at his bandage with a frown
It should be changed soon although with what he has no idea
Perhaps he could at least reverse it
It takes him a few minutes to unknot the ratty scrub top and peel it away from the wound wincing as the fabric sticks
He inhales sharply as he glances down at his chest and gets a good look at the wound
It is no longer bleeding but he can tell even in this dim lighting that the whole area is red and inflamed
Infected Wash realizes and immediately abandons all thoughts of rebinding it
It needs to breathe although he isn’t sure what good that’s going to do in this tiny dark dirty cell
Between the smell of his own waste in the corner and the fact that he hasn’t’ had a shower in at least a week ever since he broke that last illusion it certainly isn’t the healthiest of environments for an open wound
Wash tries not to think of it tries not to think of what the clear signs of infection means for the way he’s shivering and shaking for the way he’s feverish he realizes now
Maybe it won’t be the cold that kills him
Maybe it will be the fever or the infection or
I’m never going to see them again
It’s the loudest clearest thought he’s had in days and it steals the very breath from his body
They were coming for him his team of that he has no doubt
They were coming for him and he feels equal parts relief and terror at the thought
As much as he doesn’t want them to get hurt Wash wants to see them again so badly that it aches
It didn’t matter though what he wanted because
I’m never going to see them again
He leans his head back against the wall
Closes his eyes
Does not let any tears fall
Does not
The light burns his eyes when it streams into his cell unexpectedly and for a moment Wash cannot see
Someone grabs his wrists and yanks him to his feet pulling his arms behind his back and cuffing them there
Someone in armor
The hard points of it dig into his skin and Wash forces his eyes open
Big day Wash
Felix’s voice comes bright and cheerful in his ear as he half-drags Wash down the hallway
Biiiiig day
It takes almost the entire length of the five-minute walk for Wash’s eyes to adjust to the light
He feels sluggish and disoriented tries to think in simple terms like days and months and years
How much time was he losing
How long was he in that cell for
How long had it been since they recorded that video
How long how long how long
One of the guards accompanying them opens a door at the end of the hallway and Felix shoves Wash in ahead of him
Overbalanced he hits the ground and rolls himself to a sit as quickly as he can to take stock of his surroundings
It’s a small room one that he hasn’t been in before without even a window and only one door
Felix remains in the room in full armor save for his helmet and Wash counts four more
Locus the Counselor and two other space pirates
Locus takes one look at him and makes and agitated noise
That wound is infected
Huh
Felix glances down at Wash
Oh yeah I know
So
Felix look at him
He’s sick
I’m sorry am I missing something here
Felix snaps
He’s a prisoner
He’s supposed to be sick and injured
Christ it’s like you’ve never done this before
He’s supposed to be alive Locus growls
If he dies now then all of our time and resources will have been for nothing
Exactly
Control is already unhappy with just how much time and resources we’ve spent on this stupid project
You’ll forgive me if I didn’t want to waste anymore
Antibiotics and a simple bandage could have prevented
Look I’ve barely even seen him before today alright
We agreed to leave him alone in that room for three days alright if you were so concerned you could’ve checked on him yourself
Gentleman the Counselor interrupts and they both turn to glare at him
Time is of the essence here
While it would be disappointing if we lost Agent Washington because of his injuries that could have been easily prevented it is true we will still be able to heal him once we are certain that our plan has worked
Felix does have a point
It would be foolish to waste anymore medical supplies on Agent Washington when we are not even certain that he will survive this next phase
Good Felix grunts
It’ll be like Christmas fucking morning
At least then we don’t have to endure another shitty rescue attempt
Felix says it so casually that Wash knows he’s being baited but it takes him too long to wipe his face clean of emotion
He doesn’t even know what he looked like something caught between hope and fear most likely but it’s too late and Wash just gives up pretending
You’re lying he says
It’s the first time he’s spoken in days and he’s startled at just how weak and slurred his voice sounds
There was no rescue attempt
Oh I assure you there was Felix says delicately
A real mess it was too
I think they lost what a dozen soldiers
Pretty embarrassing if you ask me
Your boyfriend has himself all worked up into a dizzy and you should see Agent Carolina’s sorry excuse for leadership these days
Tucker’s not
Wash closes his mouth with a snap choking the words off as quickly as they came furious with himself for making such a stupid mistake
He cannot afford them not here
Felix latches onto his words immediately a grin splitting across his face
Who said anything about Tucker hmmm
Wash says nothing but it’s too late and Felix pushes his advantage
He’s a mess you know
Absolute embarrassment to the whole army
You know it’s his fault that they lost so many soldiers
So worried about getting his fuckbuddy back that he’s willing to let other soldiers die
You’re lying Wash says again
Felix’s face lights up even further
Oh am I
Locus we still have those recordings from their failed mission yeah
We do Locus says sounding as if he couldn’t be less interested
Felix bends down to scoop up his discarded helmet putting it back on and sitting cross-legged on the floor
He remains there for about five minutes before pulling it back off triumphant and placing it on the ground between him and Wash
I knew I had it somewhere listen to this
Wash inhales sharply as Tucker’s voice fills the room frantic and desperate
Wait
Wait we can’t just fucking leave we’re right here
Are you serious
Grif’s voice now incredulous
Tucker we’re getting slaughtered out here
Kimball wants us to pull back now
I know I know but
Tucker sucks in a breath
Look I
I can do this okay
I you take the Pelican and
Don’t you even say it
Donut
Wash’s heart is pounding the sounds of their voices cutting straight through the fog in his head and leaving it clearer than it’s been in weeks
We’re going with you
Okay Tucker says again voice grim and determined
Okay
Ali and I are going to take the left side of the building and circle back around
There are several seconds of heart-stopping silence before the explosion comes so loud that the radio pitches and then there’s yelling and screaming and Tucker is screaming
Turn it off Locus says suddenly
Wash cuts himself off just in time the no choked off into a tiny little noise of protest
He tears his gaze away from Felix’s helmet to look at Locus who is observing him with far more interest
It was foolish Locus says slowly for them to try to come for you
They are growing sloppy
They’ve always been sloppy Felix says waving a dismissive hand
They’ve always been fucking losers
The door opens again with a bang and Wash turns sharply fists clenching even though he knows he cannot raise them in front of his face
Locus’s words echo once again through his mind it must be frustrating for a soldier of your caliber to be rendered so helpless and Wash hates them for their truth
A man in scrubs drags a gurney through the door its metal edges banging off the doorframe while a second pirate follows dragging a set of machines
This pirate leaves as quickly as he came but the man in scrubs lingers leaning down to fiddle with the machines
It’s about time Felix mutters and the medic shoots him a nasty look
Excellent the Counselor says
Wash does not turn away as the Counselor turns to look at him
Put him on the table
Wash fights
He struggles with every ounce of physical energy he has left but his energy is minimal his strength is nearly gone
They are in armor and he has none and he cannot stop them from forcing him onto the gurney and securing him there binding down his wrists and ankles and chest with thick leather straps
The gurney is set at a slight incline with a strange headrest that appears hooked up to the machine
The Counselor turns to the man without armor who is still adjusting the machine next to the gurney
Is the chip ready
Yeah yeah the man says absently it’s ready
He moves behind Wash then something cradled in his hands and Wash feels the hairs on the back of his neck stand up
It won’t work he says to the Counselor
Whatever you’re planning it won’t work
Nothing you’ve done has worked the way you thought it would has it
You thought you knew me but you don’t you were wrong
Agent Washington how much do you know about nanotechnology
Wash glares at the Counselor gritting his teeth together
He won’t do it won’t let the Counselor play with him won’t answer his mocking questions like a good soldier
He won’t he won’t he won’t
As it just so happens the Counselor continues unconcerned with Wash’s lack of an answer Dr McGill is a former nanoscientist
Wash can only assume that Dr McGill is the man securing something to the headrest behind him
The Counselor gives the man a brief nod then looks back at Wash
He was imprisoned for somewhat unethical practices
It is thanks to him that we have been able to construct the elaborate alternate reality that now exists side by side with your real memories
I know that was a lie Wash reminds him unable to resist despite his former promise to remain silence
I know that was a lie I know that fucking hospital room was a lie I know that you’re a liar
For now the Counselor says mildly
Tell me Washington what do you know about nanotechnology as a form of healing mental illness
Wash knows quite a bit but he sure isn’t going to tell the Counselor that
There had been a morning not long before his captivity when Simmons had spent the entirety of breakfast one morning rattling off everything he’d just read about nanotechnology
Wash had known a bit mainly about how nanobots could be used to restructure serotonin and dopamine receptors but when Simmons had mentioned using them as a way to heal mental trauma Wash had been intrigued
He’d done his own reading and found that they could be used to break down negative emotional responses to past trauma and that they’d had great success in helping victims of PTSD
Dr Grey had shut it down immediately when he’d brought it up to her
It’s a highly invasive procedure she’d told him
And it’s very dangerous with your implants
You may not know this the Counselor says watching him closely
But if the nanobots are altered in a certain way they can eliminate not only emotional responses to certain memories but the memories themselves
Jesus Christ Felix mutters disgusted
You could not have made that reveal more anticlimactic if you tried
Let me do this part you’re ruining it
The Counselor looks slightly annoyed as Felix elbows him out of the way to Wash’s side
What the good Counselor means he says is that our little nanobot friends here can burn up your memories
Poof
Just like that
I’m told that they light before your eyes before they’re gone and I don’t mean temporarily gone
I mean gone
Get it Wash
We can tell these little bots to destroy whatever memories of yours we want
They’re lying
They have to be; Wash has never even heard of such a technology but Felix sounds so smug and the Counselor looks so pleased and Wash thinks here it is the ace
Something must show on his face because Felix leans closer one hand resting on either side of Wash’s body as he tilts his head
That’s right he says voice soft and filled with venom
Allllll of those memories you hold so near and dear gone
All that time you spent with those morons gone
All of it
When these things are done with you you’ll only remember what we want you to
His hand comes up to grip Wash’s chin fingers squeezing hard into his flesh
You won’t even remember your own name if we tell them to take it away
Wash does not break his gaze
Now Felix says letting him go and wandering around to the back of his gurney
We could just shoot these little fuckers into your bloodstream
But they’d take far longer to go into effect that way you’d fight them see
What we need to do is overstress your system
There’s a click and a hiss just behind Wash’s head and he jerks his head up and away from the headrest
Ah exactly Felix says
Exactly like that
I’d keep your right head there if I were you Wash
See because when you let it rest our little nanobot friends here are going to be clipped right into those neural implants of yours
Besides Felix says coming around the front of the gurney again
This way you have a bit of time to relive those favorite memories before they’re gone forever
So you see the Counselor says it appears that I do know you quite well after all
The edges of his smile are sharp and vicious but Wash does not look away
He has cracked too many times in front of this man and he will not allow himself to do it again
I’m almost tempted to stay and watch this part Felix says with a sigh but I think it might be best if we leave you to your own thoughts huh Wash
Give you some time with those memories
They leave the room one by one
Locus is the last to exit his gaze lingering on Wash before he closes the door
It occurs to Wash that he might be the last human being he ever lays eyes on
No he thinks fiercely
No no no
He can do this
All he must do is keep his head up keep it from leaning back onto the headrest
Easy
Simple
He has been through so much worse than this
Felix had already told him that they were trying to overstress his system to make him panic and struggle and go crazy
He just has to stay calm and not let his head fall back onto that chip until Until when
Don’t think about that he tells himself shoving down the part of him that insists they’d leave him here forever if need be
He can’t think like that can’t think about the end
He must break time off into smaller intervals and get through this minute by minute
For the first five minutes Wash does not move a single inch
He keeps his head carefully up and away from that headrest and makes his breathing even and deep
When he does need to move he keeps his motions small a careful roll of his neck a quick flex in his shoulders
He distracts himself by tensing and relaxing each of his muscles one by one so that they don’t turn numb
Keep the blood flowing as he’d been taught inBasic
In Freelancer
Well he’d been taught it at some point in his RTI training he just can’t remember which
Soon you won’t remember at all
Stop it
Wash squeezes his eyes shut and tries to focus on keeping his muscles warm again but the ache in his neck is becoming harder and harder to ignore
If he could just find a way to rest his head for a moment
No no no
This is no place for resting
Resting is for home; resting is the feel of Tucker’s head on his chest and every blanket they could get their hands on
Resting is a team at his back is the chaos and laughter and yelling that is his family
He must not rest until he is back with them
He thinks this desperately despite knowing deep down that he isn’t going to last that long despite having convinced himself that he was never going to see them again
He thinks of every single one of them of the Reds and the Blues and of Carolina and Dr Grey even of the cadets and the Feds of the look on Britton’s face when he’d set up that stupid viewing of Grey’s anatomy of Ali snickering over his drawings
He thinks of them all and he says goodbye
He says goodbye to Grif’s real laugh to Sarge’s stories to the sound of Caboose taking things apart just to put them back together
Says good-bye to red hair dye on his forearms and Carolina’s head cradled in his hands over the sink to wine and cheese with Donut to eating chocolate with Emily in her office on the Fed compound to sulking with Lopez on the cliffs to Simmons hacking that holographic lock at the archives
Says good-bye to Tucker to his smile to his energy to the way his body moved when he had his sword in his hand to the way he lit up when he talked about Junior
He thinks of them all until he cannot think of them any longer
He hates that it’s something so simple that keeps him from replaying their voices inside his head
The act of holding his head up has become impossible and agonizing the pain in his neck spreading to his shoulders and creeping down his spine until every part of him is shaking
He finds a way to hike up his shoulder and rest his head against it but this is only bearable for a minute or two at a time before he has to move again
He finds a way to rest his head on the very edge of the headrest but panics when he starts to drift and almost lets it fall onto that chip
Minutes or hours or days
He does not know how long he lays there on that gurney
There is no window to let the light in and he has lost so much time already
Everything inside him has been refocused around the pain and the panic and when he closes his eyes all he sees is red
Everything is red everything fire and blood and molten lava in his brain behind his eyes
The muscles in his neck are screaming and straining and for all he knows he’s already let his head fall and let these things into his head and maybe his memories are being ripped away one by one; maybe it’s already happening and he doesn’t even know it
He panics shaking the memories loose from their boxes just to make sure they’re still there and they are
Tucker’s smile and Caboose’s laugh and Carolina’s eyes and all thirty-seven of Sarge’s zombie survival plans he tries to pack them back up tight but he’s shaking and he doesn’t do as neat of a job as he usually does and the memories are all over the floor and the floor is red and sticky and cracking beneath his feet and everything is red red red
Wash
He hears his name as a whisper a cool brush against the fire in his skull; he turns and squints through the fog of red and
Blue
The color cuts through the hazy clouds and he lets it fill his eyes
Blue is important blue is the color of his most cherished memories and he knows these colors aqua and cobalt aqua and cobalt
His vision expands to see the shape holding the colors and they are the most precious shapes of all
Blue armor means his team blue armor means his family blue armor means Caboose and Tucker
They cannot be here he knows that but when the aqua becomes armor and the armor becomes Tucker when Tucker rips off his helmet and drops it on the ground and reaches for him everything in Wash tilts in his direction
He feels the back of his skull brush dangerously close to the chip and he freezes and he isn’t even sure if Tucker is real but he must tell him to stop stop STOP
Red red
Tucker freezes next to his gurney holding his hands palm up and staring at Wash with wide eyes
Something in the way he stops moving makes Wash pay more attention makes his gaze focus on Tucker’s face makes his heart thrum and the monitors are reacting beeping and buzzing and maybe maybe it’s real maybe he’s here maybe maybe maybe
Red red red redredredred
He can’t manage another word it’s the only one rattling in his head the only one streaming from his mouth
Tucker doesn’t move his body but his lips are moving
Wash tries to quiet the rushing noise in his head to hear what words are sounding but there’s not enough room for quiet there’s no room for anything but the red
Movement catches his eye darker blue and just as beloved and there’s Caboose barreling in through the door and bounding over to him
Wash cannot see his face cannot make out the words but he can hear the smile in them cleaving the clouds in two letting the blue stream into his head
Wash
Caboose yells and it’s not so much the words but the sheer volume of them that convinces Wash that this is real that they are real
Only Caboose in the flesh could yell at that pitch loud enough to wake the fucking dead as Tucker was so fond of putting it
They are real they are here and Wash wants to weep in relief but all that happens is red
Caboose is leaning towards him and Tucker’s arms shoots out to halt his progress but it’s too late
Caboose wraps his arms around Wash around the straps around the entire gurney and he lifts the whole thing up and hugs him tight and Wash doesn’t even care that the plates of Caboose’s armor are digging into his skin because Caboose Caboose Caboose
They all hear the click
The monitors skip one two three and they hold the silence reverent breathless terrified
The gurney falls back to the ground with a clatter as Caboose backs away hands pressing over the mouth of his helmet
Wash almost doesn’t care as the monitors start to scream as his eyes roll up and a cool rush of fire sweeps his skull
He’s been starved for his friends forced himself to believe that he’d never see them again and while he would have liked to feel Tucker’s lips on his one more timewell
One last hug with Caboose the very first one to call him friend in so very long isn’t a bad way to go
Not a bad way to go at all
Her hands are magic and they are meant for making miracles
When she was a little girl no more than five she’d found a bird with a broken wing beneath the elm tree in her yard
The poor thing was so still that she had almost stepped on him in her play
She’d dropped to her knees when she noticed the bird resting her cheek on the grass to look him in the eye
He was a sun-crow a bit smaller than the ones that typically appeared on Chorus in the spring with feathers as thick and luxurious as black velvet
His beady black eyes stared right through her and she could see it clear as day that the bird had given up
She’d gathered the tiny creature in her hands and brought him to the sunroom his heart thrumming against her fingers
It had taken copious amounts of research and the better part of the day to construct a little splint for the bird’s wing but she had done it
Oh honey her mother had said when she’d walked in on the scene
That bird’s wing is broken
I know Emily answered without looking up
I’m fixing it
She did
It had taken time and patience but the wing had healed
The bird’s broken indifference had turned to trust and the trust had turned to determination until the day came that he was flying tentatively across the sunroom and she had known it was time
She’d cupped the bird in her hands and carried him outside where he’d spread his wings and soared away into the blue
It’s a miracle her mother had breathed one hand on her chest the other shielding her eyes from the sun
Emily you’re a miracle
Nearly fifty years later and it is still her clearest memory the bird’s frantic heartbeat pulsing in her hands and the joyful lines he had made against the bright morning sky when he’d taken flight
She had done that for the bird had helped and healed him until he was strong enough to fly; had done that with her own two hands
Her hands are magic she has known it ever since that day but they are useless to her now
She clutches tight to her datapad leaning forward so that her hair falls over it like a curtain
It is the only light source in this tiny storage closet and after another quick glance to make sure the door is locked she refocuses her gaze
Tucker
Talk to me
What’s going on
We’re getting our fucking asses kicked that’s what’s going on
Tucker’s voice is breathless and shaky
She cannot see his face when he throws a quick glance down at the datapad he’d mag-clamped to his forearm but she can imagine his expression perfectly
Christ on a cracker
I knew it was too easy getting in here
Emily privately thinks that their infiltration into the hospital had been anything but easy it had been sheer dumb luck and her remarkable memory that had gotten them to Wash but she doesn’t argue the point
You just need to get back to the freight elevator it’s a straight shot to the Pelican from there
Grif is already in position
Yeah we’re fucking working on it
Another round of gunfire cuts off Tucker’s words and she can hear him cursing as he returns fire
Wash is just visible from her angle slung over Tucker’s shoulders and she winces as Tucker spins around sharply
Tucker be careful with him his head
I’m trying
More gunfire
I can’t can’t fucking shoot and argh goddammit
Caboose I need you to hold him while I kill these assholes and if you fuck anything else up so help me God
I can’t
Normally Caboose’s whisper is louder than his normal voice but now Emily can barely hear him
No
No
I can’t
Caboose for fuck’s sake
You have to carry him
I um
I don’t think it’s a good idea
For me
To do that
Well neither do I but you have to
I gotta use my sword and I can’t exactly do that and hold Wash at the same time
I don’t want to hurt him Caboose mumbles
Tucker groans
Okay just
Jesus Christ Caboose look ohhh never mind thank God
Emily taps her fingers impatiently against the datapad feeling more useless by the second as Tucker’s voice goes weak with relief
What
What
Carolina’s here Tucker says
Okay
Okay okay okay let’s just okay
Sarge is that fucking elevator ready
’Course it is
Emily flicks aglance over to Sarge’s side of the screen heart swelling with pride as she watches him pry the elevator doors straight open
Red Team had wreaked a truly glorious path of destruction to the elevator and she’s never been prouder of her boys
It was no easy task getting here in a hurry but I suppose I should’ve accounted for Blue Team running fashionably late
Just hold the fucking elevator
Emily watches as they make their way across the compound and in less than five minutes Tucker and Caboose skid into the elevator
Where’s Carolina
Simmons asks
A loud BOOM sounds several floors below them
She’s taking the stairs Tucker says
Clearing a path
Grif are you ready
Dude I’ve been circling for twenty minutes
You’re the ones taking your sweet ass time getting out of that place
His words are drowned out by a loud boom and the rest of the elevator ride is tense and loud
Emily has no idea what Carolina is doing to those space pirates but she hopes it’s something truly awful
When the door opens Emily catches a flash of teal before Carolina turns to them
Tucker run
The world is a blur as Tucker goes taking off across the field
There are people running with him but Emily cannot see them her vision restricted to Tucker’s and Sarge’s swinging datapads
Go she breathes
Go go go There is yelling and confusion and gunfire as the Pelican drops down doors opening for Tucker to dash in
He sets Wash down and turns in a half crouch in front of him sword up and angled towards the door
Come on come on That’s everyone
Go
Emily gives them thirty seconds to catch their breath before rapping on the screen of her datapad impatiently
Tucker
Let me see him
Right Tucker gasps
He rips off his helmet scooping his hair out of the way
Holy shit
Right
Okay Tucker unclips the datapad and sets it on the floor half-lifting Wash off the ground and supporting his head as if it’s made of glass
Emily practically lunges for the screen pressing her palm against it as if she can fall right through to them
Let me see his implantshold him still now She needn’t have asked
Wash is limp and boneless against Tucker
Emily squints at his implants breath catching in her throat
It isn’t the blood or the burn marks or the melted plastic wiring that make her heart skip a beat although they do a nice job of setting her head buzzing with anger
It’s the tiny black chip snapped neatly into his implants that makes her blood run cold
Nanotechnology she says in wonder fingers brushing across the screen
Oh my goodness
What does that mean
Tucker asks urgently
’Oh my goodness
’ What the fuck does that mean
Is he bleeding
Emily asks
From his ears or his nose
No Tucker says after a pause
Uh why
Gonna have to agree with Tucker on this Grif calls from off screen
What the fuck kind of fucked up question is that
And he hasn’t said anything
Or cried out
No he’s just Tucker glances down at Wash nervously
He isn’t even moving
Is that good
Donut asks hopefully
Emily doesn’t see the point in lying to them
Nothing about this is good
Epsilon I need you to run a scan on his implants
Tucker let me see the wound on his chest while he’s doing that
She hears the collective gasp before Tucker’s camera focuses on the wound red and inflamed
Right
I need you to give him those antibiotics I gave you and is there a reason you aren’t scanning Epsilon
Epsilon jolts tearing his gaze away from Wash and staring at her as if he’s just realized she’s there
Rightscanning
On it
Quickly please she says impatiently
She turns to Tucker and resists the urge to roll her eyes as now he is the one staring at Wash as if he’s going to be sick
Tucker
The antibiotics
Right Tucker mumbles
Right let me just She can see his hands trembling as he withdraws the syringe from his armor pouch and wrap the tie she’d given him around one of Wash’s forearms
He holds the needle against Wash’s skin eyes wandering over all of the wounds there before drawing the needle back
Fuck
I
I can’t I can’t do it
Give it to me Sarge says gruffly snatching the syringe out of Tucker’s hands
Emily watches him insert the syringe and depress the plunger textbook simply textbook before straightening
There
What else we got darling
Alcohol
Yes yes alcohol she says
Tucker has some
That wound needs to be cleaned and bandaged
Tucker doesn’t move just stares down at Wash
He looks really fucked up he says nervously
Really bad Emily wants to scream
She does not blame Tucker or any of them for the frozen looks and shaky limbs
They shouldn’t be there none of them not while Wash is like this
She should be there with her hands on him healing hurts and working little miracles
She should be there and she’s not
Tucker she says sharply when he continues to sit frozen
The alcohol
Give it to Sarge
Sarge moves to take the tiny bottle of alcohol from Tucker’s hands but Tucker holds the bottle out of his reach
No I’ll do it
I can do it
I just fucking pour this shit on it right
That’s right Emily says calmly
Okay okaylike all at once or
Tucker-just-pour-it-on-his-goddamn-wound
Tucker empties out the bottle onto Wash’s wound while Emily scowls impatient
Good
Good
Now take that bandage and secure it with the gauze
Tucker’s movements are slow and shaky as he brings out the gauze and medical tape
This time when Sarge reaches for the items Tucker does not resist
Emily opens her mouth to give him instructions but Sarge is working efficiently smoothing the gauze over the wound and she keeps her mouth shut
No one likes a backseat surgeon he'd teased her once and she can see that he certainly does not need one now
Perfect she says as Sarge secures the bandage
Now Epsilon did he just move
The empty alcohol bottle is falling from Tucker’s hands as he reaches for Wash
Wash
Wash
Let me see him Emily says
She sets the datapad down carefully before her crossed legs when she realizes she’s gripping it almost tightly enough to crack the screen and leans forward hands splayed out on either side of it
Let me see him
Someone angles the datapad so that she can see the scene more clearly
Donut standing off to the side with his hands pressed to his chest
Epsilon hovering just in the corner of the monitor
Tucker half-bent over Wash hands still carefully supporting his head
She can see Wash head lolling as he stirs
His head is canted towards her when his eyes crack open little slivers of sky against his pale skin
They flutter open and closed open and closed before they widen and begin to focus
Her hands are magic but they are useless to her now because she is here and Wash is there and Wash is in pain is in absolute agony
She can see it in his eyes before he starts to shudder can hear it in the hurt little noise he makes before he starts to scream
Emily you’re a miracle
She’d thought it strange the way her mother had phrased it all those years ago that it was Emily herself who was the miracle not the act she had performed not even the sight of the bird flying away high above the trees
It was almost surely a slip of the tongue but Emily had remembered it all these years the words and the way they had fallen soft from her mother’s mouth
Her hands are magic but Wash does not have her hands
He only has a whisper of her separated by miles upon miles and a thin glass screen
It will have to be enough
She is after all a miracle and that will have to do
Twenty-four days
Twenty-four days and Tucker will never let himself forget a single one
He had been sick with fear crazy with panic light-headed with fury but it was nothing nothing compared to the sheer terror he feels now watching Wash stir
He’d known getting Wash back wasn’t the end of the road the video had certainly driven home that point but it had never occurred to him that they might lose Wash the moment they got him back
He tries not to think of how the CLICK of that chip snapping into Wash's implants had sounded so very final
Wash’s eyes flutter open and closed open and closed and Tucker places a careful hand on Wash’s cheek and turns his head to face him
Wash
Wash doesn’t answer and he hears Simmons exhale shakily from across the plane
Ohhhh God
I can’t take the suspense
Tucker glances up at Epsilon who hasn’t moved a single inch since Dr Grey asked him to run a scan
Well
Did you find anything
Working on it Epsilon says tightly
I’m
I’m not even sure what I’m looking at The nanobots will be small very small Dr Grey says
It’s possible they have not begun their work yet but you should still be able to see their intent
There’s some sort offirewall or something Great Tucker says
Really great
Firewalls
In his head
This is such fucking bullshit
Tucker Carolina says suddenly leaning in be quiet
He looks at her affronted
Well excuse me for
"Tucker
" But it's not Carolina interrupting him this time it's Wash
Relief crashes through Tucker and he waves a hand at the others as if they were the ones shouting
"Wash
Wash
Fucking hell you are scaring the shit out of us
" Wash's eyes are roving over them all still dazed but this time with an air of trying to find their focus
"Tucker
" he says again and Tucker puts a hesitant hand on Wash’s face again and tilts his chin until their eyes meet
"Right here" he says and Wash's eyes finally sharpen
There's a moment of clear recognition followed by relief before a dawning horror sets in and Wash lets out a sort of strangled yell his hands flying up to his head and fisting in his hair
"Get it out get it out get it out
" "Epsilon
" Tucker roars
"What the fuck is going on
" Epsilon is flitting anxiously about Wash
"Hang on I'm trying to- to expand my scanning parameters
"Well scan faster- Wash no
" Tucker lunges as Wash starts clawing at his neural implants
He grabs Wash's wrists tugging them away from his implants which are still intact thank Christ
Wash presses his palms to his temples hunching forward with a groan and Tucker firmly covers Wash's hands with his own in case the guy gets anymore bright ideas about ripping out hardware directly wired to his fucking brain
Tucker doesn’t glance at Dr Grey but he can hear the tense impatience in her voice
Epsilon what do you see
"I think

" Epsilon hesitates
"Yeah they definitely put something in his head "Like an AI
" Carolina asks sharply at the same time that Tucker says "no fucking shit dude" followed by Donut's "something in his brain
" "If you'd all stop talking" Epsilon grits out
"I will find out and I will tell you
" They all shut up and silence falls punctuated only by the agonized sounds coming from Wash
Tucker's still got his hands pressed to the back of Wash's and can feel him shaking so violently that he's surprised he hasn't passed out yet
He said your name Tucker reminds himself
He knows who you all are
He will be okay
He will be okay
He will be
Nanobots Epsilon says sounded stunned
The good doctor already said that
Sarge says impatiently
He waves his hand in a get-on-with-it gesture
What kind of nanobots
Theyoh my God
His words send a chill straight down Tucker’s back because Epsilon sounds scared and hearing that kind of fear in Church’s voice is fucking terrifying
What
What
They’re they’re targeting his memories
Epsilon says
His avatar fizzles out for a moment and when he reappears his voice is a little stronger
They’re programed to destroy them
Not not all of them thoughit’s like they’re targeting certain ones They’re sentient
Dr Grey asks wonderingly
I’ve never even heard of such a thing
"But but how would they even do something like that
" says Donut
He's taken his helmet off and is staring imploringly around the room as if waiting for someone to tell him that this is all just one big joke
How do they have that kind of technology
"I think the better question is why
" says Simmons
"It's such an elaborate
" "Are you fucking serious
I can't
I don't care why
" sputtered Tucker
"At least not right now anyway
Jesus fuck we can analyze this later right now we just need to get them out I mean look at him
" "Alright alright" snaps Simmons his voice pitching high with stress
Stop yelling at me
How can you expect me not to yell when so sick of you snapping at everyone like we didn’t all just risk our lives
Oh my God I never said that you didn’t risk
Everybody shut up
Carolina snaps and the arguing falters
Dr Grey
Can you heal him
Well certainly Dr Grey says
But seeing as how I’m here and he’s there it’s going to be just a teensy bit tricky
Right Tucker glances down at Wash
He’s still shaking eyes half-closed but he’s quiet now in Tucker’s arms save for the occasional gasp
Can we just keep him calm or whatever until we get back to Armonia
We don’t even know if going back to Armonia is an option Carolina says her voice edging towards bitterness
In case you’ve forgotten we got kicked out
No we didn’t Simmons says
They all turn to glance at him
We didn’t get kicked out
Tucker got kicked out
We can still bring Wash home
Tucker grits his teeth but all he says is Kimball said we could bring him back
And what did Doyle say
Simmons asks
Do we know what he thinks about all of this
Doyle doesn’t have the balls to say shit to any of us Grif calls from up in the front of the Pelican and Kimball’s not going to turn us away if we show up with Wash
There will be a revolution if the News catch wind of that
Don’t worry about it Dr Grey says impatiently
Of course you’re bringing him back here
I’ll talk to Kimball and Doyle
Right Tucker mutters
He rubs his thumbs along the back of Wash’s hands reassuring himself as much as Wash
He’s here
He’s safe
They have him and they’re going to fix this
So these things might not even be active yet
Tucker startles as Wash yells and jolts so severely that he tears out of Tucker’s grasp
He half-falls onto his side retching hard one hand clutching at the back of his head
Oh God he chokes out his voice filled with such horror that it turns Tucker’s limbs to lead
Oh God oh God Right Dr Grey says briskly
Well that answers that question
Those need to come out now
There’s only one thing to do
But Tucker is turning wildly to look at Epsilon
Can you get them out of him
" Epsilon stares at him
"Get them out
" Of his head Tucker emphasizes and he grits his teeth hard when Epsilon continues to stare at him in silence
"Fuck I don't know deactivate them
Like you did with Freckles
" "Whoa you want me to- what jump into his head
Go poking around
" "Something like that yeah
" "No" says Epsilon his voice rising
"No way
I can’t
" Tucker’s right Dr Grey interrupts
She has her palm pressed up against the screen again and is staring at Wash her eyes huge
They’ve already started their work and it’s all we’ve got
Epsilon you must get in there
Now
I can’t
Epsilon says again
He’s moving away from Wash from all of them until his avatar is backed up right against the wall of the ship
"You can’t or you won't
" says Tucker angrily
Epsilon lets out a humorless laugh
"Clearly you're forgetting what happened the last time Washington and I shared a brain
"Oh that was fucking years ago" Tucker says wildly and everyone on the Pelican shoots him an incredulous look
He’s reaching and they all know it but Tucker pushes forward anyway
Epsilon come on
"Oh years ago was it years ago
So you think he's what
Completely over it
That he's fan-fucking-tastic
Healthy as a horse
Tell me Tucker how many nightmares have you guys woken him up from in the time you've known him
" Epsilon barrels on as Tucker opens his mouth and closes it again
"Well those nightmares are all thanks to me dude
" "Not all of Wash's laundry list of issues are thanks to you
" "I'm not saying they are
" Epsilon is half shouting now
"I'm saying that I'm the reason he has such a hard time dealing with them
I'm the reason his head is so goddamn unstable in the first place
He fucking hates me
And now you want me to go jumping into his neural implants without his permission
While he's already got God knows what going on inside there
" Carolina finally speaks up
"He doesn't hate you Epsilon
" "Well we may have moved from hate to dislike to wariness fuck I don't know Carolina" says Epsilon
"All I know is it took us years to have any kind of normal conversation and we're gonna be back to fucking square one if I do this
" Do you run the risk of damaging yourself if you do this
" Carolina asks and okay Tucker kind of feels like an asshole for not even thinking of that before now because Epsilon is his friend too no matter how fucking stubborn he gets no matter how tense things have been between them lately
"No" Epsilon says
"No I don't think so
But aside from the fact that feeling me in his head will totally freak him the fuck out
I don't know how deep these things have gone into his brain
" He glances around at them all watching him and sighs
"It's a bad idea
I could do more harm than good
Odds are that I will
" "And what if you don't
" asks Simmons
"What happens then
What happens if we wait until we get back to Dr Grey
Waiting is not an option Dr Grey says urgently
He won’t make it back here
At that moment a violent shudder rips through Wash
Some of the strength that's been holding him upright seems to fail and he sags to the side his forehead hitting Tucker's chest
Tucker's never seen Wash look so vulnerable in all the time he's known him not even after Sidewinder not even after the nightmares and he can't stand it another fucking second
He looks up at Epsilon desperate and pleading
"Church please
" "He'll never forgive me" Epsilon says helplessly
He turns to Carolina and repeats himself desperation coloring every word
"He'll never forgive me C
" We can tell him I made the call Tucker says
Fuck if that’s what you’re worried about blame me
Then he’ll never forgive you either Epsilon says fiercely
He’ll hate you he’ll tell you he would’ve rather died than let me in his head again
Is that what you want
For him to hate you for making this call
II Tucker glances wildly around the ship little slivers of doubt worming their way into his mind
He can’t stop running his hands over Wash’s skin through his hair across his forehead and cheeks
Would he want that
To die rather than risk letting Epsilon implant into him again
Would he
Ifuck I don’t know I don’t know
Enough Dr Grey says and they all fall silent
Enough
Tucker you’re not making this call
I am
Epsilon do it
Ican’t Epsilon says through his teeth
I can’t do it I’ll
I’ll break apart right inside his head
I can’t I can’t
You have to Dr Grey says
He will die if you don’t
Wash is strong Epsilon says wildly
He can hold on until we get to you he can fight these fucking things Christ he’s like practically unkillable
Epsilon listen to me
This isn’t just about Wash holding onto everything that makes him who he is
Every second that those things are in his brain is one more second that he runs the risk of having a stroke or a brain aneurysm
His brain physically cannot handle the amount of stress that the nanobots are putting his nervous system through
It’s it’s a ten hour plane ride right
We can just just keep him calm like Tucker said
We don’t have ten hours Dr Grey says urgently
We don’t even have one
The silence that follows is the loudest Tucker has ever heard
I don’t want Wash to die Caboose says speaking for the first time since they boarded the Pelican
If um
If he dies see it will be my fault
And II don’t want Wash to die and have it be my fault so please Church
Please will you do the scary thing
Epsilon looks at him for a long moment before turning to Carolina
C
I know Carolina says
I know
But Epsilon looks at her
Looks at Caboose at the Reds at Tucker and Wash
He walks over to him tentatively and stands there for a moment hands clenched into fists bouncing on the balls of his feet
Oh fuck fuck fuck Just then Wash screams and it’s worse than any noise he’s made so far it sounds as if something is being torn out of him and when he clamps his hands over his ears and pulls them away to paw again at the back of his head they are bright red
Tucker glances up at Epsilon terrified as Dr Grey shouts Epsilon get in there right now
I’m sorry Wash Epsilon whispers but the blood seems to have strengthened his resolve
He looks one more time at Tucker then Carolina before turning his focus on Wash
Epsilon vanishes
Ollie hold him down Dr Grey says and Tucker has no idea who the fuck she’s talking to until Sarge moves around to Wash’s other side
C’mon son let’s turn him over Sarge says
Tucker helps him roll Wash over so that he’s lying on his back
There’s been no change in Wash’s appearance yet and Tucker can’t decide if he thinks that’s a good thing or not
Do you still have that piece of leather I gave you
Dr Grey asks even as Sarge pulls a leather strap out of one of his armor pouches
What the fuck is that for
Tucker asks alarmed as Sarge eases Wash’s jaw open and carefully inserts the leather between his teeth
Is that really necessary
He isn’t ready for it when Wash tries to jerk upright but Sarge is pressing Wash’s shoulders into the ground
Wash’s eyes are squeezed shut as he struggles the noises rumbling from his throat sounding like something a trapped animal might make
Tucker’s going to be sick
Donut is already there back turned to them as he gags into the corner of the ship and Simmons pats his back awkwardly
Caboose is watching with his hands pressed over his mouth and Grif is staring determinedly out the windshield of the Pelican and
Tucker feels himself pushed out of the way as Carolina knees next to him her hands pressing down firmly on Wash’s other shoulder
Tucker get something soft for his head
There should be an emergency blanket and pillow in the first aid kit
Tucker stumbles over to the first aid kit as fast as he can yanking out the pillow and half-crawling back over to Wash
He kneels at Wash’s head and tucks the pillow carefully underneath it
Wash is still thrashing so hard that it’s kind of pointless but he makes sure that whenever Wash presses his head back into the floor that the pillows is there
Carolina and Sarge are each holding onto one of his arms keeping him steady
They are in armor and he is not but Wash still struggles as if his life depends on it and Tucker flutters his hands uselessly around Wash’s head
He’s shuddering movements sharp and jerky and Tucker’s not convinced that he isn’t already having a stroke
Tucker talk to him Dr Grey urges from the monitor
Calm him down
Tucker swallows hard inching a little closer to Wash’s head
WashWash come on you have toto calm down
He glances up at Dr Grey when Wash doesn’t begin to settle
I
I don’t think he can hear me
You have to make him hear you she says
I
I can’t what do I talk about
Anything Dr Grey says
Anything
Just let him hear your voice
Tucker looks around wildly at all of them watching them expectantly before forcing his gaze back down to Wash
Okay okay okay
Fucking hell
He takes a deep sharp breath rips off his gloves and lifts Wash’s head up off the ground resting the pillow in his lap and easing Wash’s head down onto it
After a moment’s hesitation he rests his hands carefully on either side of Wash’s head
This time when Wash jerks away Tucker holds him fast
Wash he says softer this time
Wash you’re okay
It’s me
I’ve got you
We all came and got you yeah
You’re okay
Wash falters for a moment before jerking again an agonized noise escaping his throat and Tucker tightens his hands in Wash’s hair and leans down over him
Wash listen to me
His face is hot and he’s painfully aware of everyone watching them but he ignores them just keeps his eyes on Wash’s until they finally open and lock onto his own
You have to stop
You’re going to hurt yourself and that’s gonna suck okay
You’re okay
I have you
I have you right here
Wash’s eyes squeeze shut once more but his struggles grow marginally less intense
Tucker removes the piece of leather from his mouth and rubs his thumbs along the sides of his jaw
C’mon breathe
I’ll count okay
He counts
The numbers fall heavy from his mouth one by one the only noise in the ship
Wash’s eyes flutter open on ten eyes meeting Tucker’s
Tucker
Wash does not have to speak the words for Tucker to understand the question
This is real he whispers back
I swear to God it’s real
I’m here
I’m right here
Wash exhales slowly the tension melting out of him bone by bone
His head grows heavy in Tucker’s lap arms falling back against Sarge and Carolina and when his eyes finally close they do not reopen
They do not reopen and Epsilon does not reappear
Wash is so limp and still after his struggling that Tucker can’t stop checking his pulse for the rest of the Pelican ride back
Sarge and Carolina ease off of his arms slowly but their caution is moot
Wash looks as if he’ll never move again
Tucker sits there for a while with Wash’s head in his lap before finally glancing up with a shaky breath
Everyone is still staring at him and he feels raw and exposed
What he snaps at Carolina who happens to be the nearest person and she starts slightly
Nothing she says defensive
She looks at Dr Grey
Are you sure there’s nothing else we can do
Maybe would should try to wake him up
No Dr Grey says
No absolutely not
Startling him now could very well prove disastrous
The nanobots are very likely tied directly to his sympathetic nervous system and any more stress or panic could cause
Alright alright Carolina says
She climbs to her feet starting towards the head of the Pelican
I’m going to go see if Grif can get this thing to go any faster
Uhhhh Grif calls as she approaches The answer is no Grif can’t-- Why not
Do you want us to get into a plane crash
What I want is
Tucker tunes them out and looks down at Wash feeling useless and desperate to do something
He’s stretching an arm out towards the first aid kit straining to grab it without letting go of Wash when pink armor fills his vision and Donut lifts up the case and hands it to him without a word
Thanks Tucker says and Donut nods jaw clenched hard
His eyes are red-rimmed as he looks at Wash and Tucker can see his scar through the tear tracks in his foundation
We should clean him up a little Donut mumbles voice thick with emotion
He’s a mess
Yeah Tucker says
Yeah I was thinking the same thing
I’ll help Donut says and kneels next to Tucker
Youdude you don’t have to
I know I don’t
He sniffles hard
I want to
With that Donut pulls out a small bottle of water and a towel tugs Wash’s arm across his leg and begins wiping away some of the dirt and grime
Tucker’s watches him for a moment as Donut dabs carefully at Wash’s wrist where the skin is red and scraped raw
Tucker pulls Wash’s other arm towards him and mimics Donut’s actions
The cuts are still open in some places cracked and bleeding from where Wash had clearly been fighting against restraints
Tucker tries not to think of the last time the two of them had slept together just before the mission but the memory rises anyway
Wash’s wrists bound to Tucker’s headboard as he’d gasped and whined and begged for Tucker’s touch body hot and responsive and tugging against the restraints
Tucker couldn’t take his eyes off him at the way Wash had looked underneath him at how Wash had melted under his every touch leaning into Tucker’s hands and mouth every ounce of tension gone from his body
Tucker had been happy so happy that he had done that for Wash that he had the power to make him relax and stop
They had something there something good and now
Tucker swallows hard fighting down the waves of nausea and moving on from Wash’s wrist to clean the rest of his arm
He and Donut work in silence wiping the blood from his torso and the dried urine from his legs and Donut helps hold Wash up while Tucker carefully cleans the blood from the back of his neck
He winces as he gets his first clear look at the damage done back there the burns and the cuts and that fucking chip that Tucker wants to rip out himself
He contents himself with pouring the water bottle over the top of Wash’s head and scrubbing his hands through his hair the water running down his forearms
Donut unearths a pair of sweatpants and a t-shirt from seemingly nowhere and shrugs when he notices them all looking at him incredulously
What
I thought it’d be nice for him to have some clean clothes to change into
I mean obviously they weren’t gonna let him keep his armor
His armor Tucker breathes and a glance around proves that he isn’t the only one who just thought of this
Fuck
There’s plenty of armor back in Armonia Simmons says
We’ll find him something
I will get it for him Caboose says and he stands as if he’s going to do it right the fuck now
I will get Wash’s armor
Simmons rolls his eyes
Caboose don’t be an idiot it’s just armor
But that was Wash’s armor Caboose protests sounding as if he’s about to cry
Which great just great
I painted the parts yellow for him and um it is blue under the grey and I think that is important to Wash so I will get it for him and
Caboose Tucker says exhausted
Sit the fuck down
Caboose looks at him and Tucker turns away busying himself with tugging the fresh shirt that Donut has handed him over Wash’s head
He doesn’t think he can look at Caboose without screaming yet and after a moment Caboose sits back down against the wall
Tucker and Donut maneuver Wash’s legs into the sweatpants and lay him out on the floor of the ship emergency blanket tucked up around his shoulders
It isn’t long before Tucker notices that he’s shivering slightly forehead slick with sweat so Tucker unsnaps the top half of his armor leans his back against the wall and tugs Wash against his chest wrapping the blanket around them
He doses off for a while then jolts awake to frantically check Wash’s pulse
It’s there beating strong beneath his fingers and Tucker counts them out
The numbers buzz into his brain but he counts them out determinedly into the hundreds the thousands and still he does not stop
He has after all had far worse things to count
The setting sun paints the walls of the canyon blood red
Man this is stupid
Wash closes his eyes and counts to ten before popping the seals on his helmet setting it down next to him in the grass
What’s stupid
Tucker’s helmet has been long discarded thrown across the way ten minutes earlier and he casts an exasperated look at Wash gesturing wildly
This
This training exercise
I can’t concentrate on these gun disarming techniques with the Reds playing house like loud as fuck
As if on cue Simmons’ shriek of HOW MANY TIMES DO I HAVE TO TELL YOU NOT TO WASH THE WHITE SOCKS WITH THE COLORED ONES filters across the way
Tucker looks at Wash pointedly
Wash sighs thinking
Tucker
It is vital that you learn to concentrate even in the moststressful of situations
There are times in combat when there seems to be a hundred things happening at once and it is crucial to your survival and the survival of your team that you focus your mind and
So like do you plan these speeches out ahead of time or
Tucker trails off expectantly as he settles down onto the grass squinting up at Wash in the sun
What
I don’t
I’m not giving a speech Tucker I’m just Wash falters
Talking
I’m just talking to you
You’re lecturing me
I am not
Dude you so are
Tucker vaults to his feet clearing his throat throwing his shoulders back and clasping his hands behind his back
Captain Tucker
It is of the utmost important that you focus on these rifle disarmaments
If you don’t you will surely die
What
I don’t sound like that and I don’t stand like that either come on
Pay no mind to the Reds living out their domestic AU across the way
Wash snorts
Domestic AU
Tucker drops the act for a moment and grins at him
Dude come on this shit is like textbook
He clears his throat snapping back into it
Focus your heart
Clear the cobwebs from the library of your mind
Ready your loins and
Wash giggles
It’s the only word to describe the sound that just came out of his mouth and when Tucker blinks at him incredulously Wash starts laughing head thrown back hands clasped to his chest
R-ready your loins he gasps when he can speak
He falters when he sees the way Tucker’s grinning at him soft and pleased and vaguely stunned as if he’d just gotten the wind kicked out of him
Tucker hastily adopts a more somber expression when he notices Wash staring
Yeah dude like for real any day you’re gonna make me start doing push-ups with my dick
Wash snorts again laughing and he says he says
What does he say
He had said something funny next well not that funny but it had made Tucker laugh and Wash remembered thinking that laughter looked good on him that Tucker had a face made for smiling
Wash had said something but he can’t quite remember what and the longer he dwells on it the more difficult it becomes to recall just what he was trying to remember in the first place
He had been thinking about the canyon and the blood red sun and how he and Tucker had been working on What had they been working on
He can’t remember
It’s strange because the memory had just been pulsing clear as day inside his head and now he can’t even remember what he was thinking of
The memory burns once more bright as daylight
Wash reaches for it relieved but before his fingers can brush across its beaming surface it shatters turns to sandy dust and disappears before his eyes
Wash stands there frozen hands outstretched
Both the memory and its box are gone gone without a trace and he can’t remember what it was but he knows it had been an important one
You name is Agent Washington and your memories go in the light blue box
Oh no
No no no
Wash spins eyes wide and searching but he cannot find the memory
It is gone and he turns in a circle again frantic eyes desperately seeking out all his boxes
They are still there but something is wrong horribly wrong he has had his memories shaken loose before but this is different this is
His ears catch a low buzzing hum and suddenly the air is black wrapping around him with a howl
Wash presses his hands over his ears as the howl continues and the air turns thick and tar-like until everything suddenly brightens another blue box falling from its shelf
Wash lunges forward to catch it but it hits the ground and the memory fills his mind
Connie is laughing sitting on the edge of Wash’s make-shift skateboard ramp
Alright here’s the deal
You teach me to do that and I’ll teach you to throw knives
You will
Really
Wash frowns
Hang on this is what you want to learn
Skateboarding
It’s cool Connie says breathless and she looks so earnest that Wash’s own cheeks hurt from grinning
You look cool
I do
You do
Connie stands
You knooowI was thinking
Maybe you and I could teach each other some other stuff as well
Other stuff
Like combat stuff
Not exactly
Connie grins pushing herself to a stand and stretching
You goof
Come over here and
What
Come over here and what
No Wash gasps
No you can’t have that you can’t
The memory burns bright and shatters turns to dust and the air burns thick and tar-like once more
Wash is on his hands and knees with no memory of how he got there
He tries to say it again no no no but the air is stale and swampy and he can’t see can’t think
Another memory tumbles from the shelves dark blue one his memories as David
He is running through a field of yellow sunflowers on his grandfather’s farm playing hide and seek with his sisters
There is a hiding place just up ahead and he
The memory brightens before vanishing as well
He is standing underneath a canopy and Allison is walking towards him
She is grinning and winking because he’s crying already and when she reaches him he takes her hands in his and
And what
I don’t care what Wash thinks suddenly
I don’t care what because that isn’t mine
Instead of trying to gather the memory towards him he pushes it away pushes it towards the black and howling mass surrounding him
Take it he gasps the words faint and choked
You can fucking have it
Just like the others it brightens before drifting away
Get up he screams at himself and forces himself to a stand
Before he can fully formulate his plan another memory tumbles from its shelf
Tucker and Rockslide and
Tucker's still rummaging somewhat automatically in their cupboards until he finds the sugar bowl and he slams it in front of Wash without a word glaring fiercely at Carolina
"Well excuuuuuse us but you're gonna have to do a little better than that
" No no Wash growls
He slams the memory shut boxes it back up and puts it away his head reeling
No no no you’re not taking that
The sugar bowl is strangely heavy against his palms and he cradles it almost reverently trying to figure out just what's so important about this thick glass bowl and it's snowy sweet filling
A sudden wave of fondness for Tucker crashes over him and he tries to dissect it to put the why of it into words and all he comes up with is this
Wash's family was lost to him years ago his friends are long gone and his new team is still learning how to trust him but he does apparently have someone who knows how he takes his coffee
"Carolina" he says "get out
" No
They weren’t taking this memory from him whatever these things were
They were not taking Rockslide and the sugar bowl and Tucker
He locks it away again and before the darkness can shake it free and tear it to pieces Wash lunges for one of the green boxes and dumps one of those memories out instead
Naomi is glaring at him fiercely in the bathroom
There’s red hair dye all over the sink and all over her hands and face and he tries to still the thudding of his heart
It’s not blood just hair dye and his fear rapidly turns to fury
Wash shoves it at the black mass and it devours it greedily ripping the memory apart
He hurls another one at it of Naomi’s first gymnastics meet something that he was never meant to see anyway
Wash edges himself closer to the blue boxes putting his back to them
They were not taking them
He will throw everything else away he will give up everything else but
It grows more and more difficult as time stretches on to keep the memories safe
They tumble free from their boxes time and time again and although Wash can scoop them up he is exhausted they are falling from his fingers he is
The air seems to expand somehow and he squints through the blackness
He has fallen again to his knees forearms pressed into the ground as he concentrates with everything he has but he can’t see anything
Panic
It explodes in his brain with no warning a panic separate from the attempted destruction of his memories
His body and brain recognize the source before he does something instinctual kicking his nervous system straight into fight or flight mode
Fight or flight
Fight or flight
Fight or
You should have run Wash
He cannot run; flight is impossible in this place
He has spent the past five years trying desperately to escape his own thoughts and knows that it is something he can never do
He knows that there is nowhere to run to
Wash gathers every single memory in his head close to him scattering boxes on the floor and shoves the blackness away
He slams a wall up locking himself and the memories in keeping the blackness and this new presence out this presence that feels
Familiar
Everything suddenly feels so familiar; there is something lurking just outside the mist and it has been here before
Wash
Where are you
Wash presses his hands against the transparent wall he has just erected
The effort that it takes to keep it up is nearly unbearable and he knows that he will not be able to do so for long but he must because that voice that voice
Wash
Through the glass through the mist he sees a shape in power armor searching frantically a shape that he knows would know anywhere
They could take everything from him every piece and he would know that shape
There have been so many lies stuffed inside his head recently but he knows that this is not one of them
He knows without a doubt that this is real that the shape running towards him is
Epsilon
Wash breathes
The word come out as a question even though he already knows that yes this is Epsilon that yes Epsilon is here in his head; he is falling apart and Epsilon is in his head
Something cracks along his foundations as Epsilon turns towards the sound of his voice
He turns running towards Wash and something else splinters in the ceiling this time little bits of dust falling as the nanobots chip away mercilessly at his mind and Epsilon is still moving towards him
NO
Wash screams it so loudly that even the nanobots falter in their work
Epsilon skids to a halt ten feet in front of the wall palms up and out as he looks at Wash
The black cloud of nanobots are swirling around him but Epsilon seems unaffected appearing to hardly even notice them as his hands fall limply to his sides and he glances around
Wash clenches his fists and watches Epsilon take it all in
The colored boxes
The red walls
The shelves and the floor cracked clean in two beneath their feet with the gaping chasm that lies just beneath it
Wash cannot see the horror on Epsilon’s face as he turns to face Wash once more but he doesn’t have to to know it’s there
Wash
Get out Wash whispers
Wash Don’t say my name don’t say anything to me get out get out get out
I Epsilon steadies himself
I came to help
GET OUT
Everything inside of him shudders are he screams it bits of the ceiling falling on their heads
Do you like what you see he asks Epsilon voice unhinged and as vicious as he can make it
He gestures at the floor the walls the falling ceiling
It’s your handiwork after all
Look Epsilon says determinedly
Do you think I wanna be here
This is the last place I want to be
Then go
Go
I fucking can’t
Epsilon moves closer to him and does not back down even when Wash slams his palms against the glass
If you think I’m gonna go back out there and explain to Tucker and Carolina and the rest of the Agent Washington Protection Squad that I didn’t even fucking try to help you then I’ve got news for you you’re wrong
Help me help me how
You can’t help me
Actually yes I can
Epsilon considers the nanobots for the first time
I’m gonna destroy these fuckers
I can do this Wash says
I can do this I can take care of this
No you can’t
Epsilon snaps
This isn’t about like your mental fortitude
These things are miniature computer programs
News flash
You’re not a computer program
I am
You’ll fuck it up Wash says wildly
You’ll you’ll fuck it up no
Epsilon please
I want you to go please please
Wash you have to let me help you
Epsilon’s voice is frantic again edging towards pleading as he lifts a hand and knocks on the wall
You have to take this down
You’re dying
These things are killing you
Wash
When are we
What
I said when are we
Wash shakes his head hard hands fisting in his hair
You can’t be here it’s impossible they ripped you out I remember I remember
No no
Wash this isn’t Freelancer Epsilon says quickly
We’re on Chorus
I’m going crazy Wash mutters
He presses his hands to his face and breathes in and out in and out
I’m going crazy
Wash
GET OUT OF MY HEAD
Epsilon’s avatar fizzles and for a moment Wash thinks he’s leaving
As he watches Epsilon’s armor falls away disintegrates into nothing and he’s left standing in front of Wash in the same blue hoodie the same sneakers that he wore in Freelancer
We’re on Chorus Epsilon says again determined
Look look at all of this
These weren’t here last time remember
He gestures and Wash follows the motion towards a memory filled with brightly colored shades of red and blue armor
They are seated around a table in the mess hall in Armonia on Chorus Wash thinks on Chorus Chorus Chorus and he and Carolina are laughing as Tucker and Grif launch into another ridiculous story
Epsilon clears his throat
They weren’t here this time
They came for me
His voice is shaky and vulnerable like a child’s disbelieving despite the fact that his faith in them never wavered for a second
Another memory brushes by him far more recent this time all bright colors and blurry shapes the determined set of Tucker’s jaw as he cut through the straps binding Wash to that gurney before lifting Wash away and carrying him away from that hell
Yeah Epsilon says and there is no helmet to hide the way his jaw clenches
They sure as fuck did
Wash swallows eyes tracking the memory uncertainly as it flits around his head
I there’s too much in here I can’t
Wash Epsilon says I can fix this but you have to let me
Please
Wash squeezes his eyes shut forehead dropping against the glass
I can’t
Epsilon I can’t do this again
There’s a soft clunk as Epsilon drops his own forehead down against the glass right against Wash’s separated only by a thin glass pane
Fucking hell Wash
Neither can I
The silence that falls between them is the heaviest thing he’s ever felt and Wash swallows hard
I don’t want to die
I don’t want you to fucking die either Jesus Christ so I’m going to
I’m going to let you deactivate thesethings
 and I’m going to fight them
Wash clenches his jaw hard pressing his forehead harder into the glass
But but if I do diecan you tell them
Wash
Thanks
Wash takes a breath
Tell them thanks
They came for me twice
Tell them thanks
Please
Will you do that
Yeah Epsilon says
He clears his throat
Yeah
I’ll uh
I’ll do that
And can you tell Tucker he stops
He can’t finish that sentence but Tucker’s face blossoms in his memory bright and beautiful and brave and he hears Epsilon’s breath stutter at the sudden warmth that envelops them both
Can youcan you just tell him
I
Please
I yeah
I’ll tell him
Okay
Thenthen okay
You’re so fucking dramatic Epsilon says pushing away from the wall
Christ
We doing this or what
Wash takes a step back
Shakes his hands out
Brings the wall crashing down
He feels everything now the nanobots chipping away mercilessly at his mind; the memories fighting for his attention; and Epsilon familiar in the worst of ways
Wash hates that it feels as if something has clicked into place and he can tell Epsilon hates it too because they can both feel it can both feel every part of each other
There’s no time to think on it now
The nanobots swirl around him and for a moment he can’t see anything
He forces his eyes to stay open and finds Epsilon’s shape through the mist so much smaller without his armor
Before Wash can do or say anything the relentless pressure of his memories wins and one of them spills forth
He’s jolting awake form a nightmare clutching a pillow in his hands
Ha Caboose’s voice says triumphantly
I told you that would work
Wash blinks staring at the pillow that's clenched in his fists and tries to think but the thoughts are bouncing around his skull too quickly for him to order back into formation- "Yeah but it took like ten minutes Caboose
 uh Wash
You good
" Wash blinks hard but he still can't make the blurry forms across the room come into focus
"Maine
" he asks and the blurry forms freeze
"
 do you not know where you are
" The memory brightens and Wash clutches at it in terror but instead of disappearing the brightness lingers
This time it does not break apart it merely dulls retreating from the burning intensity to its usual steady warmth
Holy shit Epsilons gasps and Wash blinks the brightness away to see him standing there
Man these things are ruthless
The nanobots surge memories pushing against them and Wash pulls the memories in close as Epsilon does something that makes the black cloud retreat
Tell tell me what to do Wash gasps
His head is throbbing and the memory that pushes forward is so intense that it drowns out Epsilon’s words the UNSC Tartarus and Felix and Locus and
Oh my God the second mercenary moans
What is this a therapy session
Look
The bottom line is the Freelancer and her little sim trooper friends are turning into real thorns in our sides
We need people to take them out
You in or what Agent Washington
You can drop the Agent Washington snaps
It’s just Washington now
You two got names
I’m Felix the second mercenary says
He jabs a thumb at his comrade
And that’s Locus
And you my friendare hired
Wash makes to push this memory away as he did with the other false ones but he falters
It’s so vivid and there’s nothing shaky or wrong with it to suggest that it is falseand yet and yet That didn’t happen Wash whispers to himself but as he says the words he isn’t quite sure that he believes them
Thatthat didn’t The memory does not dissolve but it dims
Epsilon bats it away eyes huge behind his glasses
Uh what the fuck was that
That was that was
Did they put that in your head
I
How
Wash is unable to answer as the memories from his time as a space pirate tumble loose from their dark orange boxes pressing in on him insistently
The ones that he had been holding so deliberately close of Basic of Freelancer of most importantly the sim troopers are shoved to the background and as he watches the nanobots begin to tear away at them
No Wash gasps but his limbs are sluggish and slow; he is trapped inside this cloud of false memories and he can’t get out can’t get out can’t get out
Oh
Epsilon says and Wash can just barely make out his shape
Oh okay okay I see what they’re trying to do hold on Wash just hold on I’ve got this so fucking hard
Wash has no choice the press of the false memories on his mind is insistent to the point of pain and he falls to the ground trying not to be sick
He attempts to shove them away and pull the real memories towards himself but they are twisted and tangled together and it is growing more and more difficult to tell them apart
Your name is Agent Washington he tells himself firmly squeezing his eyes shut tight
Your friends call you
--DavidWashLeonardAlphaEpsilon
Your name is
But he doesn’t know he doesn’t know what his name is and he doesn’t know what the color of the stripes on his armor are he thought they were yellow but that was wrong they’re aqua he remembers that that it was so very important to choose the aqua accents although he couldn’t say why they had pulled at him so insistently that he had given in strange but every time he looked at them he felt he felt
Better
Wash
Tucker’s voice whispers through his head
Wash knows it instantly and what’s more he knows that this is not a memory
Wash turns towards it desperate and searching
Tucker me
I’ve got you
We all came and got you yeah
You’re okay
Tucker is not here but his voice whispers on desperate and terrified
I can’t he tells the voice
Tucker I can’t I can’t
I think I’m dying I think I’m gonna die
Wash listen to me Tucker says again
His voice has changed has deepened into that sure liquid tone that always makes Wash stop and pay attention
He knows that voice
He trusts that voice he will do whatever that voice tells him too
You have to stop
You’re going to hurt yourself and that’s gonna suck okay
You’re okay
I have you
I have you right here
Wash screws his face up tight pressing his forehead hard into the ground and covering the back of his head
Okay he chokes out
Okay Tucker
Okay okay okay He does not hear Tucker’s voice again but he holds onto its echo in one hand and his sanity in the other
Epsilon is cursing fluently in the background but Wash does not look up
He keeps his eyes shut focuses on holding onto his name
Your name is Agent Washington
Your friends call you Wash
Your friends call you Wash
It is the last inch the very last piece of himself
He doesn’t know what the nanobots are doing anymore and isn’t even sure if he cares but he holds tight to this piece and protects it with everything he has
Your friends call you Wash call you Wash your friends call you Wash Wash Wash Wash your friends call you your friends your friends yourfriendsyourfriendsyourfriends
The pressure in his head starts to diminish slowly
There’s a brightness pressing against his eyelids that Wash at first does not dare open his eyes to see but as the air grows lighter he lifts his head and squints
The nanobots are not gone but their thick toxic cloud has become a nearly-transparent mist spiraling gently inside of a thick glass cylinder that Epsilon is regarding
He’s breathing heavily hands on his knees a faintly triumphant look on his face
Wash’s gaze wanders away from him to the rest of the mess that is his mind
The walls and ceiling are crumbling bits of wood everywhere revealing a nearly-black midnight sky beyond them
There are memories everywhere brushing past his face and tangling in his hair their boxes cracked and discarded on the floor
The bloody trench that had been carved out when they ripped Epsilon from him the first time is visible once more floorboards cracked and ripped away
As Wash watches one of his memories slips towards it and Wash throws himself forward
His mind tilts as he does so and he’s barely able to save both the memory and himself from tumbling into the pit
Wash rights himself trembling and falls back heavily on the side of the pit his feet still dangling over the edge of it
Across the way Epsilon’s sneakers walk their way into his vision and Wash looks up to meet his wary eyes
Uhhh you wanna back up a little
If I did all that hard work only for you to fall intowhatever this isI’m gonna be pissed
His voice is deliberately light but it doesn’t mask the deeper fear hidden underneath it and suddenly Wash is more exhausted than he’s ever been in his life
Did you do it
Epsilon sighs glancing at the trapped nanobots
I can’t destroy them
Not without removing that chip it’s sort of a safety catch and they can’t exactly remove that on the Pelican
They’re deactivated though for now
Can they be reactivated
Yes Epsilon says after a moment’s hesitation
But only only if your blood pressure or heart rate rise
So you just have tostay calm
Stay calm
Yeah
How am I how can I
Wash waves a hand at the mess
How can I stay calm when thiswhen I Wash you have to he says urgently
You have to look I can help we can put this back together we can fix this
No we can’t Wash says sharply
We can’tI don’t want your help I justIdon’t you get it
I’m not strong enough for this not again I can’t His voice breaks and he stares into the pit at the churning red mass far below
Epsilon fidgets nervously before sitting down across from Wash his legs hanging over the cavern as well
Do you know which fragment you were supposed to get
Epsilon asks suddenly
If Carolina hadn’t if you hadn’t ended up with me
Do you know who you were supposed to be paired with
No Wash says dully
No and I don’t care either
Eta
It was Eta
Who the fuck is
He was Alpha’s fear
Wash stares at Epsilon for a few seconds waiting for the punchline
It doesn’t come
On the contrary Epsilon is watching him as if he’s just made some grand revelation that Wash should be happy about it as if it doesn’t just fucking figure that
Wash laughs
It starts as a giggle and escalates to a hard howling thing that leaves him bent at the waist wheezing for breath
Oh he finally manages
Of of course he was
Why wouldn’t they look at me and see that why wouldn’t they look at me and see
No Wash
Epsilon’s voice is so bright and earnest that Wash looks up at him
No don’t you get it
You weren’t supposed to get Eta because you’re like
I don’t know fear personified
It wasn’t because they looked at you and saw fear
Then why
Wash grits his teeth furious at himself for his curiosity
Freelancer was a lie
It didn’t matter what AI he was supposed to be paired with
It hadn’t mattered then and it sure didn’t matter now
It was because people look at you and they’re Epsilon falters his earnest words suddenly halting and clumsy
They’re justnot that anymore
Not what anymore
Wash asks when it becomes clear that Epsilon is still floundering
Epsilon sighs
Notafraid anymore
They’re they feel The silence that settles is almost thick enough to touch and when Epsilon breaks it his voice is firm
Brave
Wash
You were supposed to get Alpha’s fear because people look at you and they feel brave
Wash is shaking his head before Epsilon has even finished speaking
No
They don’tI’m not You do
Epsilon is speaking quickly now his words rushed and relieved now that he’s articulated it
You do
You look at all those kids back in the capital
And our guys
Caboose you didn’t get to see but he tried to rip that Pelican apart with his fucking bare hands like a hundred feet up in the air to get to you
He’s terrified of heights did you know that
Always has been
Terrified
And Tuckerwith the knives andandwith youlook it’s just a thing you do alright
It’s not
You made me brave
Wash snorts
And look where that got us
It got us here Epsilon says
Here
On this planet
With them
I know it’s been a long roadI know it’s beena long way down but Epsilon breathes deep before speaking again
You make people brave he emphasizes
Freelancer may have been a shit show but every so often they got something right
They got that right
I don’t feel brave Wash says
His throat feels tight
I don’tI can’tI’m so tired Epsilon
I know
I can’t Wash gestures around at his mind at the memories scattered on the floor at the crumbling walls and all the red
I can’t do this again
Yes you can Epsilon says fiercely
Yes you fucking can
Come on don’t make me give a motivational speech
Wash doesn’t laugh
It took me years last time
You were alone last time Epsilon says
Not anymore
You you’ve got a whole fucking army out there Wash
You don’t know what they were like while you were gone
All of them
It doesn’t work without you Wash
They don’t work without you
Not anymore
Wash looks at him for a moment before turning his gaze back to the cavern
He kicks his feet aimlessly staring into the red memories swirling around him soft and fleeting
There are so many and it will take so long to put them back in their boxes
One of them brushes across his face catching in his hair
It is a lovely shade of sky blue and Wash closes his eyes breathing it
Rockslide and Tucker
And his hands clenched tight around a sugar bowl
The simulation troopers all skulk back into the kitchen Carolina brushing past them angrily on her way out
Wash watches them all in turn focusing on the little differences in their armored bodies the proud lift of Sarge's shoulders Caboose's constant fidgeting the occasional tilt of Simmons' head to the left
Little details that he did not notice at first that no one would notice at first but that he's come to recognize over the past month
His hands are still holding tight to the sugar bowl and he suddenly feels as off balanced and dizzy as he did when he raised his bloody palms to the sky back on Sidewinder
He looks again at the sugar bowl
Thinks of fluffy pancakes and strong coffee and birthday cake with chocolate frosting
Something falls into place
Wash lets the memory swirl around him and when it has played out to its fullest he gathers it reverently to his chest
He tucks it away inside of its robin’s egg blue box and places it back on the highest shelf
He turns to the next one
Tucker will remember the Pelican ride back to Armonia as a series of snapshots of moments flashing bright amidst long stretches of darkness
His sleep is fitful broken by shards of nightmares and a desperate need to repeatedly check that Wash is still breathing that his heart is still beating that he is alive and here pressed tight to Tucker’s chest
During one of these intervals of lucidity he wakes to find nearly everyone else asleep as well scattered around the Pelican
Even Dr Grey has dosed off one hand propped up under her chin the other resting just in front of her datapad screen
Aside from Grif piloting the plane only Sarge and Carolina are awake standing  by the cockpit and speaking in hushed voices
Sarge’s helmet is off for once the lines of his face drawn and tired and Tucker watches as he places a hand on Carolina’s shoulder
After a moment she reaches up to cover it with her own
The two of them stand there like that for a while in silence looking out over the rest of the ship like sentinels and their steady presence lulls Tucker back to sleep
He awakens again what feels like five minutes later to Dr Grey’s voice speaking softly to Carolina
We’re in Dr Grey says when she notices Tucker awake and listening
I spoke to Kimball and Doyle and we’re in
Grif is cleared to land the Pelican in Armonia
Tucker notices now that the datapad is swaying slightly and a closer look shows that Dr Grey is setting a brisk pace down a hallway
You’re sure
Tucker asks uncertainly
Of course I’m sure
A quick glance at Carolina’s face proves that she is not convinced but Tucker nods and drifts back into an uneasy sleep
The next time he awakens several hours later it is far less peaceful
A high-pitched alarmed shriek splits the air and Tucker startles so badly that he nearly knocks Wash to the floor
Tucker wraps one arm around Wash’s chest and fumbles for his sword with the other igniting it and angling it in front of the two of them
Wha
Whas’wrong
Donut clucks his tongue loudly in disapproval and Tucker snaps his gaze over towards the sound
Tucker
Put that sword away before you ream it right through someone
Tucker deactivates his sword but does not lower it
Who screamed
Simmons did Dr Grey says and the words have no sooner left her mouth than Tucker’s eyes land on Simmons standing across the ship with a hand pressed to his chest
After I expressly told everyone that it was imperative that we not startle Wash never mind
Epsilon what happened
Tucker’s heart leaps into his throat as he glances around wildly finally locating Epsilon’s avatar standing in front of the datapad that connects them to Dr Grey
Church
What the fuck’s going on are you His fingers unconsciously find Wash’s pulse again and he swallows hard
Are you still implanted in him
Epsilon takes a beat too long to answer and he gives his head a little shake as if to clear it
I yeah
Yeah I am
Is he alright
Carolina asks
Tucker hadn’t even noticed her crossing the Pelican but she kneels now at his side
Are you alright
Yeah Epsilon says again answering too quickly this time
He looks around at their suspicious faces and sighs
Yeah
We are
I mean
I am
He is
We it’s okay
Specifics Epsilon Dr Grey says impatiently snapping her fingers
Is he mentally lucid
How much damage did the nanobots do
Were you able to destroy them
No now hold on
Epsilon exclaims as she starts to interrupt and Caboose makes a noise of despair
Let me talk Jesus Christ
I wasn’t able to destroy them but I was able to deactivate them
Forfor now
So they can be reactivated
Tucker asks
Yes Dr Grey and Epsilon say at the same time
She huffs crossing her arms as he glares at her
Well get on with it then
Yes they can be reactivated Epsilon says again
They’re behind a firewall
I made it as secure as I could butthe slightest amount of stress or fear orhell any strong emotion could bring the whole fucking thing crashing down
And his memories
Dr Grey urges
How much damage did the nanobots do to them
A bit Epsilon says after another hesitation that feels as if it stretches on forever
They actually destroyed some of his memories
Donut whispers his hands covering his mouth
Espilon nods and Tucker clenches his fists hard in the blanket covering Wash
He doesn’t want to ask it but
Which ones
I don’t know Epsilon says
I can’t see them
They’re gone
But um
But he can get them back right
Caboose asks nervously
I forget things sometimes but then I remember them again
Epsilon shifts but when it appears that no one else is going to answer for him he drops his shoulders and sighs
Thisthis isn’t like that Caboose
It’s very unlikely Wash will be able to recover the memories he’s lost Dr Grey says
None of them miss the sudden loss of warmth from her tone
I’ll have to see the extent of the damage butit’s likely that what’s done is done
There’s a long silence before Simmons speaks up
Were they targeting specific memories
Epsilon looks at him in surprise
Yeah I how did you know
Because this whole thing is ridiculous
Simmons exclaims throwing up his arms
It’s what I’ve been saying the whole fucking time
The resources they would’ve needed to pull this off it’s absurd
There’s no way they would’ve gone through all of this trouble if they didn’t have a very specific plan in mind
He’s right Carolina says
Don’t tell me you all missed how easy it was for us to get in there
They all turn to look at her incredulously
Easy
Tucker sputters
You call that easy
We had to sneak in through the fucking subway system and almost died like fifteen times
Used up my whole stock of shotgun shells
Sarge adds holding his gun up to demonstrate
Can’t remember the last time that happened
I thought it was pretty easy Grif calls from up front
That’s because you weren’t there Tucker snaps
All you had to do was fly the plane
I’m telling you there’s no way they just let us walk in there
That’s not what I meant Carolina says
I meant look I’m not saying they just let us walk in there
If they had managed to kill every last one of us while we were in there all the better for them
But a plan like thisthere’s no way they didn’t have a contingency plan in place in the event that we got Wash out
Okay Tucker says slowly
Well we got Wash out
What the fuck was their contingency plan
I don’t know Carolina says glancing at Epsilon
What was it
Epsilon suddenly looks uncomfortable shifting his weight from one foot to the other
Theywell they put something in his head
We’ve established that Junebug Sarge grunts
They put the nanobots in there to
No no somethingelse
Epsilon hesitates
Therethere were fake memories in there
Fake memories
Dr Grey asks wonderingly
You mean they attempted to construct some sort of alternate reality using his neural interface
Epsilon nods
Bingo
But it didn’t work she says slowly and that’s why they had to put the nanobots in his head to get rid of everything that contradicted the alternate reality
A last ditch attempt to make ‘em stick Sarge adds
But why
Simmons asks
He looks ready to rip his hair out
Why go through the trouble
The tension returns to Epsilon all at once and Tucker quashes down the urge to repeat the question
They they wanted him to think that he was one of them
One of them what
Tucker asks blankly
You mean they wanted him to think he was a super douchey mercenary
Something like that Epsilon says grimly
They wanted him to think that he was working for Charon
Tucker snorts
Bet that failed miserably
It did Epsilon says his voice tight
But it wasn’t for lack for trying
You mean Donut swallows hard looking faintly ill
You mean they tried to brainwash him
That’s exactly what they tried to do
Dr Grey says the cold lifeless fury returning to her voice
That’s what this was all about
They tried to brainwash him
Okay Simmons says slowly
Okay so they try to brainwash Washington into thinking he’s working for Charon because
Because if Wash had come back here thinking that we were his enemies he probably would have taken out half the base before anyone understood what was happening Carolina says
She looks at each of them in turn
And it would’ve started with all of you
Wash wouldn’t Tucker protests
He couldn’t
Wash wouldn’t Carolina says grimly
Whoever they were trying to turn him into probably would have
A sudden chill sucks all the warmth from the ship leaving them looking at each other uncertainly
But it didn’t work Tucker says again trying to make his voice sound reassuring
Caboose stop fucking looking at him like that it didn’t work
No Epsilon says with a sigh
But we’re not out of the woods yet
There’s still every chance these things could reactivate and start their work again
So Tucker looks at Wash
He’s shifted them during the conversation so that Wash is leaned up against his side head heavy on Tucker’s shoulder
So hehe’s in there yeah
This time Epsilon did not hesitate
He’s in there
And he’s lucid
Dr Grey asks quickly
He understands what’s happening
Epsilon laughs a little
Oh he understands alright
He fought them like a motherfucker
Tucker feels a fierce sort of pride well up in his chest
Of course he did
He’s Agent Washington Simmons says as if that explains everything
Cockroach Sarge supplies and the two of them nod
But why won’t he wake up
Caboose whispers so quietly that they almost miss it
Becausebecausewell because his head’s still kind of a mess Epsilon says
These things really did a number on him
Things are a littlescrambled right now
He’s just trying to put his head back together
Can’t you help him
Donut asks but Epsilon’s shaking his head before the question is even complete
No
He doesn’t want my help
Tucker shifts uncomfortably
Was hewas he mad at you
He can practically hear Grif’s eye roll from across the plane
This isn’t grade school Tucker
Tucker huffs
Well
He wasn’t exactly happy to see me Epsilon says
But wewe took care of things
Alright
He isn’t telling the full story Tucker can tell but he doesn’t press the issue
Epsilon sighs again
Look I’m gonna log back off
Help keep an eye on these things for Wash
Does he know we’re here
Tucker blurts
He flushes as every eye in the Pelican turns to him
I mean does he know we got him out
He doesn’t still think he’s in thatthat room does he
The mere thought of that room
Wash bound to the gurney eyes wide and red sweating and shaking red red red the click the chip had made sealing into his impants how long was he there how long it’s nearly enough to send him into a panic but Tucker pushes it down
There’s no time for it now
No no he knows you got him out Epsilon says his voice as close to reassuring as Tucker has heard yet
Epsilon looks at him long and considering
He knows you’re here
Good Tucker says
Good that’s good
Uh
Church
Thanks
Yeah yeah shut the fuck up Tucker Epsilon says tiredly before winking away
They all let out a collective breath as his avatar winks away
Well Donut says
II guess that could’ve been worse
How could that have been worse
Simmons exclaims
They tried to brainwash Wash into killing us all
They put even more memories into his head
Doesn’t he already have enough going on in there
Let’s not panic until we have to Dr Grey says sharply and certainly not in front of Wash
Grif how far to Armonia
About another hour Grif says
And before a certain someone asks I’m going as fast as I can
Carolina rolls her eyes but says nothing
She glances at Wash and Tucker arms swinging a little awkwardly before turning to retrieve her helmet
Tucker tries to get some more rest but his nerves are far too jittery
He tucks the blanket around Wash and carefully lays him down beginning the laborious process of snapping his own armor back on
A tense awkward silence settles over them all and Tucker suddenly realizes that he has no idea what they’re walking into
Apparently he isn’t the only one thinking it
Carolina is standing at the door before the Pelican fully lands hand on the release seal
I’ll talk to Kimball and Doyle she says abruptly
I already did that silly Dr Grey says exasperated
She’s still connected to them via the datapad despite the fact that they are now officially inside of Armonia’s borders
Tucker can see her pacing in the landing bay now as a harried looking Dr Pickles pushes a stretcher towards her in the background
I told you they want you all to come back and bring Wash home
I know Carolina says automatically
I just just want to make sure
Grif snorts
What you think Kimball was lying about letting us back in
Think she’s gonna pull a gun out and start offing us
That isn’t funny Grif Carolina snaps
And I have no idea what Vanessa Kimball is going to do which is why I would prefer to be the one who finds out
I can do it Tucker offers glancing at Carolina
I mean
I can go double check
Make sure Kimball and Doyle are cool with it
He can’t quite shake the guilt that had worked its way in several hours ago ever since Simmons had made a point to mention that it was Tucker who had gotten thrown out
He isn’t sure why this hadn’t occurred to him he’d just assumed she’d booted the rest of them shortly after
Well except Caboose
Tucker knows full well that Kimball hadn’t kicked Caboose out as Caboose hadn’t left his side since Kimball had ordered him to leave
Tucker glances at him now sitting quietly several yards away
There is still a sick furious terror churning in Tucker’s gut but every time he tries to think of Caboose hugging Wash so tightly that the gurney left the ground all he can see is Ali turning his face away as Tucker’s sword had burned through the muscle and bone of his arm and the scream that Tucker knows he’ll hear for the rest of his life
They’d all made one hell of a mess of things but in the end they’d gotten Wash back and right now that is what matters
No Carolina says in response to his question
I’ll do it
You all stay here and I’ll check
Tucker frowns
What are you so worried about
You’re not the one who got kicked out
She ignores him but the line of her mouth grows even thinner
Tucker blinks at her
Wait did you
Can it Blue Sarge snaps and Tucker gives it up
Tucker busies himself with putting his armor back on and smooths the blanket over Wash’s shoulders
He hasn’t moved a single inch and Tucker surreptitiously checks his pulse again
It’s still there onetwothree still beating steady beneath his fingers
Despite Dr Grey’s repeated assurances that they’d be fine his heart still lurches when Grif lands the Pelican
The ramp descends and he can see Dr Grey Kimball and Doyle standing outside the doors of the base
I’ll be right back Carolina says putting a hand on Tucker’s shoulder as he moves to lift Wash
Just wait here
Carolina starts out of the Pelican the moment it opens but something in her seems to falter halfway down the ramp
Oh honestly Donut mutters and gives her shoulder a little push
Go on now
She jumps glancing back at him before squaring her shoulders and continuing her march down the ramp
They all watch as she approaches Kimball and Doyle watch Dr Grey bounce impatiently in the background watch the conversation that they cannot hear
Less than a minute later Carolina turns and gives the signal for them to follow
Tucker adjusts the blanket around Wash’s shoulders and lifts him up carefully following the Reds down the ramp
Dr Grey starts towards them first at a brisk walk then a quick jog then a dead sprint Pickles trailing behind her with a stretcher
She reaches them well before he does her hands fluttering about Wash’s head as she regards him in Tucker’s arms
Oh Wash she whispers her voice equal parts despair and relief
Goodness gracious look at you
For a moment she merely looks at him moving only when Sarge brushes a hand against the small of her back
Go on now
Work your magic Em
She nods firmly unhooking her medical scanner from its place on her belt
She runs it carefully over Wash’s body continuing even as Pickles appears with the stretcher and Tucker lays Wash out on it
Take him to the infirmary she says absently and keeps scanning as they start across the landing bay
Oh dear Doyle mumbles as they get closer
Well he doesn’t look good at all
Very helpful Donald Dr Grey snaps without looking up as they pass him
Tucker glances up from his position by Wash’s stretcher to give a tight nod to Kimball and Doyle before refocusing his attention
He’s only paying a bit of attention to their surroundings but it strikes him as more than a little suspicious that they don’t see a single soldier on their way to the infirmary
The thought is only an absent-minded one as Epsilon pops back on Wash’s chest as they walk
Oh good we’re here
It’s about fucking time
Grif throws up his arms
I told you I went as fast as I could
Like you could’ve done any better Had a slightly more important job buddy
Oh my God Grif mutters
Everyone’s a critic Moving on Carolina says loudly from where she’s marching along up front
Epsilon how are we doing
Right right
We’re good
We’re uhyeah
He claps his hands turning to Dr Grey
We ready to do this thing
We’re ready she says
Dr James is already scrubbed in and waiting for us
What do you need from me
The best thing you can do is tell me immediately if the nanobots start to reactivate
That’s the most important thing
Got it
Read you loud and clear doc
Good
They reach the infirmary doors less than a moment later and Dr Grey halts abruptly facing them all with her hand up
Before you all start trying to charge in
Tucker groans and he isn’t the only one
Oh come on
No loved ones allowed in the operating room she says firmly
Come on now sillies
You’ve gotten him this far
I’ll take it from here
Tucker grits his teeth
Fine
He glances down at Wash hesitating and Grif sighs loudly
Just kiss him already for fuck’s sake
Tucker shoots him a glare before leaning down and doing just that planting a kiss square on Wash’s forehead
You’re gonna be fine he mutters uselessly as Donut tearfully pats Wash’s hand
Just fine
You always are
It takes everything in him not to follow the stretcher through the doors but he just stands there clenching his hands into tight fists
Soso we just wait
Donut asks as if they haven’t all done it a million times before as if they didn’t just spend the last twenty-four days waiting waiting waiting
Yeah Tucker says with a sigh
We just fucking waitwhat he snaps when he notices Grif watching him with an almost melancholy expression
Dude Grif says
You are so
Fucked Tucker says
Yeah
I know
They wait for hours
Five of them to be exact
Tucker knows
He counts every single one
Tucker doesn’t move from his spot on the bench directly from across the infirmary doors and Caboose doesn’t move from his spot at the end of the hallway
Well that’s not exactly true as Caboose is incapable of sitting still for more than two minutes at a time but he neither leaves nor tries to inch closer to the infirmary doors
He just stays in his spot sitting standing sleeping bouncing
The Reds huddle in a little group at the other end of the hall bickering and eating and finally sleeping as well
Tucker hasn’t seen Carolina since they’d wheeled Wash through the infirmary doors when she’d stared at them for a while before doing an about face and exiting down the hall
Captain Tucker
Tucker jumps turning to see Britton and Kennedy tip-toeing down the hallway past the sleeping Caboose
You’re back Britton breathes glancing at the infirmary doors
Doesdoes that mean
Yeah Tucker says and she clutches at Kennedy’s arm in delight
Yeah we got Wash back
Oh thank goodness she says weakly
I knew it I knew you would
Yeah Tucker frowns at them
How did you know we were back anyway
Tucker thinks again on the suspicious lack of soldiers during their dash to the infirmary
If no one had known about their return then there would have been a few surprised soldiers milling around not a complete and lack of human presence
We were keeping watch Kennedy says shiftily
Tucker folds his arms across his chest and levels him with a stare
You were hiding
In the supply closet Britton confirms
Kennedy slaps a hand over his visor
BB
What
He knew anyway
She turns impatiently back to Tucker
We just want to know how Agent Washington is
When Tucker hesitates she hurries to continue
We don’t want to bother him
I know that this is the part where only his lover and his closest friends wait outside but we just want to know if he’s okay
We will relay the message to our friends Kennedy says and we’ll keep this hallway clear if you need it
Oh uhwell thanks Tucker says awkwardly
Hehe’s pretty beat up but Dr Grey’s a fucking wizard and she’s working her magic now
But he’s alive right
Yeah Tucker says
Yeah he’s alive
Something relaxes in both of them as he says it and Britton pats her hand on Kennedy’s arm
Kenny the ration bars
Oh right
Kennedy fumbles in his armor pouches before fishing out a handful of ration bars and handing one to Tucker
We brought food Captain
Tucker glances between him and the ration bar
Kenny Kennedy
Really
That’s correct sir Kennedy says blithely
Jesus Christ
Tucker takes the ration bar and gestures
Go on I’m sure Grif’s eaten through his stash about now
He watches as they hand out the bars to the Reds then place one carefully on the bench next to Caboose
He unwraps his own ration bar and stares at it guilt swimming uncomfortably in his stomach
They’d wanted to go on that awful mission to rescue Wash both of them but Kimball had absolutely forbid anyone under the age of seventeen to go
Tucker wonders if they would have made it out of there if they had
Nine dead three critical two lost limbs thirty minutes
Tucker rips off his helmet and upper body armor and dumps it on the floor between his feet trying not to be sick
The tenuous calm that that had overtaken him since seeing Epsilon very nearly shatters and he casts around desperately for something to focus on
Armor
He stares at his armor thinking hard
It fits him like a glove but he wonders if they could modify it to fit Wash
It was after all Freelancer armor and Tucker had been through hell and back with it
It was certainly better than whatever scraps of armor they were going to find for Wash
Tucker could spray paint it for him grey and yellow and maybe a little strip of aqua somewhere inconspicuous
Like a hickey Tucker would tell him with a wink and probably a filthy kiss and Wash would roll his eyes but try not to grin and he’d kiss Tucker back mouth opening with a sigh
But the daydream cuts off there because Tucker starts thinking of that hickey on Wash’s neck on the video and just how it got there and the fury that bubbles up in him leaves him light-headed
He drops his head between his knees and breathes deep busies himself with counting Caboose’s snores from down the hall
Someone’s hand rests on his back a comforting weight helping to anchor him
I’m okay Tucker mutters at the floor
I’m okay I justI’m okay
He keeps breathing in time to Caboose’s snores and the hand doesn’t move just continues to press in between his shoulder blades
Tucker draws in a final breath and when he lifts his head from in between his knees it is to see Kimball sitting next to him
She says nothing just looks at him brown eyes sad but her hand is still on his back unwavering in its weight
Tucker has his arms around her neck without even realizing it was something he planned to do
She is in armor save for her helmet and the points dig into Tucker’s chest and arms but he doesn’t care just presses his cheek into the shoulder guard and fights against the howl he feels welling up inside of him
Kimball hugs him back her palms pressing firmly into his back the loose strands of her hair tickling his face
Over her shoulder Tucker sees Carolina leaning against the doorway with her arms crossed watching them
I’m sorry Tucker mutters into her hair
I just
I couldn’t leave him there
I couldn’t
Kimball does not tell him it’s okay but she doesn’t pull away from him either and they stay there like that for a while until something settles in Tucker’s chest
They break apart to the sound of the infirmary doors opening Tucker hastily wiping at his eyes
It isn’t Dr Grey but rather Dr James who emerges tugging down her scrub cap with a sigh
She looks so dejected that Tucker’s instantly on his feet heart in his throat
What
What
He’s stable she assures him
But
But Dr Grey hasn’t been able to get the nanobots out
Is she going to be able to
Simmons asks alarmed
It’s too early to tell
She glances around at all of them
She’s working very hard
It’s just an update
You should all get some rest
We could be here a while
She heads back into the infirmary and no one moves
No one moves a single inch
What if she can’t get them out
Donut whispers and there is no answer for his words only a resounding sickening silence
It’s late into the night when Dr Grey herself comes out
She looks at all of them and sighs but does not look surprised to see them sitting there
Tucker stands
Did you get them
No she says abruptly
No I didn’t
They’re still in there
Tucker bites down the rest of his questions and waits
I had to close she says
I’m going to spend the rest of the night looking at his brain scans and seeing if there’s anything I missed
For now he’s stable
Epsilon is monitoring his vitals and brain activity and will let me know at once if anything is amiss
There is no waver in her voice no break in her expression to suggest that anything is horribly wrong but warning bells go off in Tucker’s head nonetheless
It’s the way she is standing he realizes the way she is holding herself so carefully shoulders back chin lifted arms held slightly away from her sides
Her eyes hold their usual steel but her bones appear made of glass as if the merest touch might shatter her
Something’s wrong Tucker realizes
Something’s very very wrong
Donut clears his throat tentatively
Can we
No Dr Grey snaps and Donut huffs affronted
No you cannot go in there
He needs his rest
We’re just gonna weep at his bedside not throw a party Grif mutters
Somehow I doubt that very much
They eye each other before Dr Grey folds her arms carefully so carefully across her chest
Fine
Two by two
You must be quiet and you must be quick
Pickles if you need to throw anyone out please do not hesitate to do so
What
Tucker asks as Dr Grey turns to him in particular
He thinks she’s going to say something but she just presses her lips together in a thin line and sweeps off towards her office
He stands immediately Donut falling into step beside him
The lights are dimmed the glow of the monitors standing out brightly in the darkness and they each take a seat by Wash’s bed
Tucker hesitates before reaching out to brush Wash’s hand with his fingers
He looks so much smaller Donut whispers and Tucker can see what he means
He does look smaller attached to so many tubes and wires a thick bandage wrapped around most of his head
It feels as if they’ve only been there for ten seconds before Donut is standing tugging Tucker away with a sniff
Come on
Let’s let the others say hi
Grif and Simmons go in next followed by Sarge by himself when Caboose plants his feet at the door and staunchly refuses
Let him be Carolina snaps when she sees Tucker opening his mouth furiously and Tucker does clunking his head back against the wall and closing his eyes
He can’t stand it staying out here when Wash is in there alone
No one tries to stop him when he rises ten minutes later and heads towards the infirmary doors until Pickles throws out an arm from where he’s standing sentinel in front of the doors
Sir I’m sorry but you can’t go back in there
Pickles looks like he barely tips the scale at one hundred pounds but Tucker resists the urge to bodily move him out of the way
I just
I just want to see him
You already saw him
I know but Tucker hesitates struggling to find words to describe how he’s feeling right now how he can’t breathe how Wash being out of his sight for so long after what he’d just been through has left Tucker on the verge of panic all day how he’s half-convinced that Wash is going to die in the middle of the night all alone and
Tucker focuses on this last part
He shouldn’t be alone right now
He’s unconscious Pickles says
He won’t know you’re there
You don’t know that
Wrong thing to say as Pickles swells
Sir he says I am a doctor
I do know and besides he isn’t alone
The Epsilon AI is monitoring his vitals
What a comforting thought Tucker deadpans
Look
I just
I just
Dude he just wants to go in there and hold his lover’s hand Grif mutters from where he’s lying face down on the bench in full armor
C’mon have you never seen a movie
Or read a fucking book
Ever
Have you ever read a book
Simmons snarks and Grif musters up the energy to lift his head to shoot Simmons a glare
Something softens in Pickles face and Tucker makes a mental note to thank Grif
Well II suppose if you’re not going to make any noise I’m not Tucker says quickly
I’m just gonna go in there and sit
Quietly
Pickles eyes him
And hold his hand
And hold his hand
Oh well alright Pickles says and pushes the door open for Tucker
Tucker slips through before Pickles can change his mind
The infirmary is dark save for the glowing monitors of the machines and for Epsilon the brightest light of them all
He’s sitting cross-legged on Wash’s chest head in his hands and as Tucker inches closer he can make out what he’s saying
So anyway Carolina’s bitchin’ and moanin’ about how hungry she is well not really but she was thinking it which I know because I’m in her head anyway
We run into Sarge because you know why wouldn’t Sarge be prowling the fucking hallways on his night off  and he surprise surprise is also hungry
So then they start bonding over how hungry they are and turns out Sarge knows some super secret place where they can get fried chicken
So I log off at this point because I’m like fuck it I cannot be responsible for what happens next
Next thing I know I wake up an hour later and they’re like miles away from the base fucking miles you would’ve thrown a fit standing in the middle of an alleyway
So then
This is the best part
Grif fucking melts out of the shadows and starts dialing into the secret radio frequency of this mystery chef-woman he’s like Wolfbat to Betty Crocker code seven nine eight five what-the-fuck-ever and then it actually works and the three of them go in there and she actually bakes them fried chicken
Epsilon laughs a little lifting his face from his hands to look at Wash
Like I said you would’ve had a fit
But uhit made Carolina really happy soI guess that was cool andthought you’d like to see it
So
There you go
I’ve got more stories if
He catches sudden sight of Tucker standing frozen in the doorway and comes to an abrupt halt
Hi Tucker says stupidly and inches forward until he’s tentatively lowering himself into the chair next to Wash
Can he hear you
Yeah Epsilon says
Yeah
He’s pretty far under butso am I I guess
Tucker looks at Wash so still and silent and small and after a sideways glance at Epsilon lifts up Wash’s hand
Can he hear me
Epsilon shrugs
I don’t know
Why don’t you talk to him for a while
Tucker hesitates glancing back at the door
Pickles said I should be quiet
Pickles is an idiot Epsilon says with a roll of his helmet
Well
He did just assist Grey in a twelve-hour surgery so I guess he can’t be that much of an idiot but kid’s not a brain surgeon and he doesn’t know shit about AI s
Should he be operating on Wash’s brain if he isn’t a neurosurgeon
Oh he’s not
Epsilon sighs
That’s kind of the problem
Grey’s the only neurosurgeon this army’s got and And
And Wash’s implants are a mess
He catches the look on Tucker’s face
Look he’s stable for now alright
The point is Pickles doesn’t really get how this all works and if you want to talk to Wash
Epsilon pauses visibly struggling before muttering Think he’d like to hear your voice
Or something
I guess
Whatwhat should I talk about
Epsilon shrugs
Tell him a story
A real one
I thinkI think that’s what he needs the most right now
Something real
Okay
Tucker pauses trying to think of something he hasn’t told Wash already and is surprised at just how difficult this is
He’d told Wash a lot at Rockslide on the way to the Archives at the crash site
Stories about Blood Gulch about Junior about his childhood about Basic training
Wash was a good listener asking questions in all the right places and sometimes not always but sometimes he’d give Tucker a story back
Alright
Well how about this one time in Blood Gulch Caboose lost his helmet and one of his gloves
Epsilon snorts
One of his gloves
Only one Tucker confirms with a grin
The left one
So he comes shuffling into the living room where Church and I were watching TV one of those rare days we had signal you know so we were living that shit up
Caboose starts tearing the room apart lifting up the couch we’re sitting on lifting us up so he could look under us
The funniest part was watching Church lose his fucking mind ‘cause he was trying to pretend he didn’t notice like if we didn’t give Caboose attention he’d go away
Tucker snickers continuing
Well that didn’t exactly work but Caboose did sit down right in between us on that tiny ass couch and started watching TV
It freaked Church out so much because Caboose can’t shut the fuck up you know that he jumped up and started demanding what was wrong
Next thing you know we’re spending the next three fucking hours looking for Caboose’s helmet
Tucker reflects his thumb rubbing absent-minded patterns into the back of Wash’s hand
Now that I think about it that may have been his plan all along
Where did you find the helmet
Epsilon asks
He’s leaning back palms behind him legs crossed over Wash’s heart
Oh so it turns out Caboose had left it in the fucking storage closet at Red Base don’t ask he says throwing up a palm when Epsilon starts laughing
So Church storms in there like a fucking wrecking ball and gets the fucking helmet and glove back and presents it to Caboose like he’s returning from war
Which the way Caboose reacted you’d have thought he was
Tucker grins at the memory and although he can’t see Epsilon’s face he suspects that he is too
Caboose he really loved the guy
Church
Epsilon hesitates
Alpha
Yeah Tucker says
That’s the understatement of the century
I think he likes you too Epsilon teases
Well some days
I think he likes you some days too Tucker says
Mondays and Wednesdays maybe
Epsilon looks at him then knocks lightly on Wash’s chest with his fist
He loves Wash too butwho doesn’t am I right
Thought half the base was gonna lose it when he was gone
Kinda wish he could’ve seen that Tucker says
All those people lining up for him
He’ll never fucking believe it
He might
Can you
Tucker stops suddenly feeling foolish
Never mind
No come on what
Can youtell himcan you just tell him I’m here
I don’t have to
Epsilon turns to look at Wash
He can hear you
Really
Really
Oh Tucker says suddenly at a total loss for words
Do you
I can log off if you
Thanks Tucker says before he can lose his nerve
Epsilon pauses
Are youtalking to him or No you dumbfuck Tucker says and rolls his eyes
I’m talking to you
Thanks
For deactivating those things
Oh Epsilon says
I couldn’t get them out so
I mean
Kinda a moot point
Tucker shrugs
Kinda sounds to me like you saved his life
Dr Grey saved his life Epsilon corrects
Don’t think I would’ve pulled my shit together if she hadn’t been there yelling at me to stop being a little bitch
Yeah well Tucker says with a sigh
I wasn’t much better
He glances back at Wash squeezing his hand a little tighter and Epsilon doesn’t miss the motion
So do you want me to log off
No Tucker says quickly
No it’s okay
Really
Besides it’s your turn to tell him a story
Epsilon looks up at him but Tucker doesn’t meet his eye just wraps his other hand around Wash’s as well
Okay Epsilon says
Okay let me think Tucker startles awake the next morning disoriented batting the hair out of his face
What
What is it
What’s happening
I said I thought I told you not to come back in here
Aw fuck
Tucker squints up at Dr Grey who is looming over him with her arms folded
Right Tucker says slowly
Right
You did say that but But you fancy yourself above the rules
I wanted to hold his hand Tucker says
He lifts up his hand still intertwined with Wash’s
He’d fallen asleep right there with his head on the edge of Wash’s mattress
Epsilon is standing on the other side of Wash arms folded and glancing up at Dr Grey
His postures is stiff and tense and Tucker sits up a little straighter in alarm with the distinct feeling that he’s missed something
What’s wrong
Dr Grey sighs
Tucker come with me
There’s something I need to discuss with all of you
Tucker hesitates glancing back at Wash but Dr Grey continues
Epsilon is going to stay with him
With a nod Tucker gets up reluctantly and follows her into her office where Kimball Doyle Carolina and the rest of the sim troopers are crowded
Dr Grey tugs off her scrub cap and folds it neatly on the table in front of her clasping her hands on top of it
I need another set of hands
Sure I can’t help
Sarge asks
Something about the way he says it makes Tucker think that it’s a point he’s brought up many times in the last several hours and he looks a little closer at Dr Grey
She smiles at him a little sadly
If it were any other surgery I have no doubt that you could
But I need a neurosurgeon
You know that
Um Tucker says squinting at her suspiciously
Aren’t you a neurosurgeon
I’m an everything surgeon Dr Grey says dismissively
Including a neurosurgeon
But in order to fix the wires in Wash’s brain I need another set of hands
Neurosurgeon hands
Steady hands
The best hands
Well
Other than mine of course
She straightens then shoulders pushed back as she looks at them each in turn
We need she says dramatically to call in the Architect
Tucker can’t help but feel as if they are failing to give her some expected reaction and a quick glance around the room proves that everyone else feels similarly
Everyone is staring at her blankly save for Doyle who nods enthusiastically and mutters Oh right quite right
The silence stretches until it grows awkward and Grif clears his throat
Uhwho
Dr Grey’s shoulders slump
The Architect she emphasizes then sighs when everyone stares at her
I forgot you wouldn’t know who he is we worked together for a time
He’s a traveling surgeon and we spent a bit of time working together when I was with the Feds
The man’s a genius you know like me
Did things with his hands that I’ve never even seen before
And where is this magical mystery surgeon now
Tucker asks
The outskirts she says
They don’t get much medical attention out there
So this guy iswhat a saint
Tucker Grif says tiredly rubbing his eyes
Don’t
Look I’m sorry but we don’t know this guy some weirdo who calls himself the Architect is going to come and put his hands all up in Wash’s brain
He doesn’t call himself the Architect Dr Grey protests
That’s just what everyone else calls him
It’s art really what he can do to a human brain
His name is Alexander
Oh great so Alexander the Architect is gonna come and play which-wire-do-I-cut in Wash’s brain
He looks around at them imploringly
I mean come on
I know him
Tucker looks at Dr Grey
What
You said ‘some guy we don’t know
’ Dr Grey’s glaring at him eyes narrowed
I know him
Do you really think I would let anyone who was anything less than perfect within a hundred yards of Wash
No Tucker mutters
No I okay
Yeah I mean do do whatever you think is best
I wasn’t asking your permission she says coolly and if you come into my infirmary and stress out Wash like you’ve been stressing everyone else out lately then you won’t be allowed within a hundred yards of him
What
I wasn’t Is that understood
Yes Tucker grits out
It’s understood
Good Dr Grey says in that same icy tone before turning back to Kimball and Doyle
Now I’ll have to see if I can contact him radio reception is a little spotty where he is
Youyou mean to say you’re in contact with him
Doyle sputters
That you could just call him up whenever you pleased
And what makes you so sure he’s going to come when you ask
Kimball adds
I’m not sure Dr Grey says
But I think I can make a pretty convincing argument
Besides he can’t resist a case like this
So he likes a challenge does he
Sarge says
Hmm
Well sounds to me like we can’t hope for a better man on the case
Precisely Dr Grey says briskly
I’ll make contact and keep you all informed
They all stand getting ready to go when Dr Grey turns to Tucker
Tucker a word
Ooooooh someone’s in trouble Grif snickers
Tucker flips him off before heading down the hallway where Dr Grey is waiting with crossed arms
I know you’re scared she says without preamble and I don’t blame you one teensy bit
Tucker huffs
I’m not scared
You’re terrified she says
You’re terrified for Wash
But so is everyone else
I know that
Do you
Tucker stops taking in a deep calming breath
Look he says calmly
I just
I don’t care about everyone else’s feelings right now
I’m sorry but I just don’t
I know I’ve fucked up
I know I’ve gotten people---I know that
And that’s for me to fucking fucking own up to or deal with or whatever but but right now I care about Wash
That’s whose corner I’m in
I failed him for twenty-four days
Twenty-four fucking days
I’m not failing him for another goddamn second
You didn’t fail him Dr Grey says
There’s nothing there was no way
I did Tucker says firmly
I did
I failed him and everyone else that I led onto that mission
That’s on me
I know that
But right now I just want to help him get better
So do I Dr Grey says
So do I Tucker
And I need you to trust me to do that
I do he says before he really has time to even consider the answer
Even when he does it’s still the same
II really do
Tucker leaves her office only to take a seat right outside the infirmary doors where Caboose has already set up camp
The two of them sit there in silence for about ten minutes before Tucker can’t take it anymore
Tucker leans his head back until it rests against the wall of the ceiling with a clunk
Oh my God just come over here Caboose
No that’s okay Caboose says his voice sounding all wounded and shit
I think I’ll just
I’ll stay here
Yeah
It’s the soft somber tone of Caboose’s voice that has Tucker lifting his head and squinting at him
Have you eaten today
When Caboose doesn’t answer Tucker heaves a sigh
Caboose come here
He pauses
Please
This time Caboose stands and shuffles over to him
Tucker fishes a ration bar out of one of his armor pockets and shoves it at Caboose
Eat no take your helmet off first Caboose Jesus Christ
Caboose pops the seals on his helmet and to Tucker’s surprise hands it to him instead of setting it on the floor
Will you um
Will you hold this for me
Tucker stares at him
Huh
It’s just um
Caboose glances down at his helmet turning it over carefully in his hands
It’s just that see Wash made it for me
And I would like to be careful with it and you
Well
You are very loud and annoying but you were very very careful with Wash when we found him more careful than I was so
I would like you to be careful with this too
Please
Caboose Tucker mutters but he huffs and takes Caboose’s stupid Mark V helmet the one that Wash had agonized over and spray painted fifteen times the one that Tucker had fixed the wiring in
Fine
Justjust eat the fucking ration bar okay
Okay Caboose says quietly and then lapse into silence
I’m still mad at you Tucker says abruptly once Caboose has his mouth sufficiently full of food
Like just so we’re clear
I’m really fucking pissed
Okay
You could’ve you just you gotta be more careful alright
Caboose nods sadly
I will make sure not to hug people anymore
Ugghhhhh
Tucker leans down dropping his head down on top of Caboose’s helmet
That’s not what I said Caboose
You just gotta be careful
Like move slowly
Slowly
Yeah like Tucker opens his arms out to the air and mimics wrapping his arms around someone slowly
You know like that
Caboose is still staring at him like he’s speaking a foreign language
Hug the air
Tucker casts a look of despair up at the ceiling heaves a sigh and leans in towards Caboose
Like this you idiot
He wraps his arms around Caboose’s neck and Caboose latches on instantly squeezing Tucker’s waist like a vice and burying his head into Tucker’s shoulder
Not so tight Tucker gasps that’s another thing Jesus fuck
If you walk in that room and hug Wash so tight you crack a rib
Sorry Caboose whispers but rather than letting go of Tucker he loosens his grip and like settles in for the long haul
I’m sorry
I will be very very careful and very very slow
Okay
Is Wash going to die because of me
Tucker pulls away so that he can look in Caboose’s eyes which are of course filled with gigantic crocodile tears
Wash is not going to die
Okay but you are not a doctor and also you do not sound very sure
Ugh Caboose look
I don’t know what the fuck is gonna happen and you fucked up like you really really fucked up but but Tucker struggles before leaning back against the wall
So did I alright
I actually did get people killed on that mission
The mission with the loud mines
Fucking bingo
Oh
Okay
Caboose pauses
Except I ah I don’t know if that’s the same thing
See you did not hug someone too fast and too hard and shoot scary botonans into their brain
It’s nanobots Caboose
Right nannerbots into one of your best friends’ brain so
Yeah
Well
Tucker swallows hard
I did chop off one of my best friend’s hands so
He still can’t think about it has no idea how he’s going to look Ali in the face or any of the people who lost friends on a mission that he rushed them into
I fucked up too
That’s all I’m saying
Don’t tell me I didn’t
I justwe both fucked up
Okay
Okay Caboose says and they sit there in silence Tucker holding Caboose’s helmet carefully in his hands
They both jump when the door opens and Dr Grey emerges
How is he
Tucker asks
He keeps his voice calm and somber trying to paint the perfect picture of the calm caring soldier who is absolutely not going to stress out his injured boyfriend
Dr Grey slants him a suspicious look
He’s awake
He’s very groggy but he’s lucid
I think he’d like to see you both
They stand eagerly Tucker still clutching Caboose’s helmet
Dr Grey throws her arms across the infirmary door and glares at them both
I will be watching his monitors like a sunhawk and if I see so much as a blip on them you’re out of there
Both of you
Is that understood
Yes ma’am Caboose says while Tucker nods vigorously
She eyes them once more pushing the door open and leading the way
Wash I brought your friends
Dr Grey gestures at two chairs that she’s pulled up on one sit of Wash’s bed and adds in an undertone Sit
Tucker and Caboose hasten to sit and she retreats a little
Tucker clenches his hands in his lap resisting the urge to grab Wash’s hand or touch his face
He looks so fragile thin and exhausted with tubes and wire all over the fucking place but his eyes are open unfocused and weary but open nonetheless open and bright
Epsilon is sitting on the nightstand next to Wash’s bed and he looks up a little nervously
Tucker gives him a tight nod tries to smile gives it up and redirects his gaze back to Wash
Hey Wash
Wash’s eyes sharpen and focus then blinking at Tucker
Hi he whispers and now Tucker’s feeling a bit more sympathetic towards Caboose’s unchecked desire to throw his arms around him and never let go
Tucker throat closes up and he finds himself for one of the few times in his life at a complete loss of what to say
They are all there but the phrases and questions racing through his brain don’t seem like they would have the Dr Grey stamp of approval are you okay what happened to you when was the last time you ate what did they do to you I swear to God I’m gonna kill every last one of them
You look cold he blurts instead
He gets a little half-grin out of it
M’fine Wash says and he makes a little patting motion with his hand at the air as if he wanted to pat Tucker’s arm reassuringly but didn’t quite make it that far
Oh my God Tucker huffs
He catches Wash’s hand and squeezes as tightly as he dares
Don’t you start that I’m fine bullshit
You do not look very fine Agent Washington Caboose adds and Dr Grey makes a half-choking noise of despair
’S’okay Wash slurs at her
They’re okay
He looks cold Tucker says in a long-suffering tone
He gets real cold when he sleeps
I should’ve put one on him last night that was fucking stupid of me Dr Grey eyes him but crosses the room to the supply closet at gets out another blanket
To Tucker surprise she does not lay the blanket over Wash herself but hands it to Tucker
Thanks he says and unfolds it carefully tucking it in around the edges of Wash’s body
It’s thinner than he would’ve liked but it’s dense and warm and pretty soft for a hospital blanket
Thanks Wash says and Tucker re-grips his hand
You’re welcome
He waggles his eyebrows at Wash
Anything else I can do to make you feel better
Epsilon groans and Dr Grey huffs but Wash does that little half-smile again
Done enough he says voice a little stronger
Got me out’f there
At that moment Caboose bursts into tears burying his face in his hands and leaning his elbows on the side of Wash’s bed
Caboose
Tucker hisses as Dr Grey looks horrified and Epsilon slaps a hand over his visor
Caboose
Wash takes his free hand and pats Caboose’s curly head awkwardly
M’fine
No you aren’t Caboose sobs you have lots of scary surgeries coming up and they are all my fault because I hugged you too hard when I shouldn’t have hugged you and
Caboose Wash protests but Caboose barrels right on over him and I will be more careful and if you do not ever want me to hug you again then that will be fine I will do whatever you want because I am very sorry and and
Okay Dr Grey says tightly
Caboose that’s quite enough
I’m sorry I hugged you too hard Caboose sobs into his hands
Wash pats his hair again
’S’okaykindaneeded one
He pauses
Could maybe use one now
Caboose looks up at him then brown eyes huge
You could
Yeah Wash says
Think so
Caboose moves slowly wrapping his arms around Wash and holding him delicately
Wash pats his back his free hand still tangled in Tucker’s and Tucker leans in too
I knew you were coming Wash mutters
The whole time
I knew
Tucker has to swallow hard around the lump that’s closed in his throat
Sorry we took so long
You came Wash says
You both of you twice you came for me
Always Tucker says his voice fierce and thick with what is definitely not tears
Dude you can get your ass snatched by the bad guys every fucking week and we will come and get you
Right Caboose
Right Caboose says voice thick with what is absolutely tears
Tucker can feel them on his fucking arm
Right
Always
Alright Dr Grey says softly after another minute of this
Alright let’s make sure he has some air now
Tucker pulls back wiping surreptitiously at his eyes
Dr Grey hands Caboose a tissue
Bunch of saps Epsilon mutters
Shut the fuck up Church
Wash you should try to get some rest Dr Grey says softly and as Tucker takes a closer look he can see Wash fighting to keep his eyes open
Wash’s gaze flicks between him and Caboose
Will you
Staying right here Tucker says firmly redoubling his grip around Wash’s hand
I’m not leaving unless I have to take a shit and even then I’ll be right back
Fuck maybe I’ll have Grey bring me a bedpan
Not necessary Wash mutters his voice slurred with sleep
Thanks
Yeah Tucker says
Yeah
He rubs his thumb back and forth over Wash’s knuckles until he drifts off to sleep
The monitors hold steady beeping in time with his breath and Tucker counts them onetwothree onetwothree until Caboose’s head is resting on the side of Wash’s bed and his snores add to the count and Tucker leans his own head on the bed tucks his forehead in right next to Wash’s side and drifts off to sleep as well
The wooden shelves containing his memories arc high into the air so high that Wash cannot see their dusty tops
He knows every inch though every knot every nail meticulously memorized from when he’d first built them
Cherry wood he realizes now running a hand over one of the empty shelves a blue memory held tight in the other
I built them out of cherry wood
Back when he was a little boy when he was still David he helped his grandfather chop down a cherry tree on the family farm
He has only fuzzy memories of his father as he was too young to remember when he left but he remembers his grandfather and the farm very well
So many of Wash’s firsts had taken place on that farm his first time learning to drive his first kiss with a boy in the sunflower fields his first time having sex with girl from the city on the banks of the pond
One of his earliest memories is of standing next to the farm’s fallen cherry tree ripped down by a particularly ferocious storm
Wash remembers standing next to the tree ankle-deep in fallen pink petals and trying not to cry
He loved that tree and he knew his grandfather did too but his grandfather merely looked thoughtful not sad
David he’d said fetch me the chainsaw from the barn
Go on
He’d reluctantly brought his grandfather the chainsaw and stood a careful distance away with his hands over his ears as his grandfather sawed one of the branches clean off
His grandfather had beckoned him closer and shown him the fresh cut wood inside
Beautiful isn’t it
It was
The tree was old very old and the cherry wood inside was a deep rich red full of whirls and knots
His grandfather had used every bit of that fallen tree he’d made a bench a table a box several trinkets for Wash and his sisters
He’d given Wash the wood from one of the branches and taught him to whittle and although Wash didn’t think he was very good at it he enjoyed the feel of the knife in his hands and the way the wood shavings smelled as they fell to the floor
Wash had used every bit of that branch until all that was left was a small smooth block that fit perfectly in his pocket
He’d carried it all the way with him up to Freelancer where he assumed it had been lost with the rest of the ship
He turns this memory over in his hands now of cracking open the wood of that tree with his grandfather before boxing it up carefully and placing its shelf
He hadn’t been thinking when he’d built them so long ago but the wood is precisely the same color of that fallen cherry tree
The shelves fade beneath his hands and he frowns turning to look at the open sky
For a moment everything is bright until it isn’t and Wash wakes squinting in the darkened infirmary
There’s something soft beneath his palm and he glances down his arm to see his hand resting on top of Tucker’s dreads
Tucker is breathing low and steady his hand curled around Wash’s shin
Need some help with that
Wash’s eyes flick to Epsilon sitting on his chest like a blue flame so bright that Wash wonders how he missed him
With what
With Epsilon gestures vaguely at Wash’s head
With whatever you were doing in there
Wash turns his attention inward once more to the boxes lined up on their cherry shelves
No he says without turning to look back at Epsilon
I don’t
The infirmary disappears around him the touch of Tucker’s hair beneath his fingers the last real thing he feels before the waking word fades before his eyes and he is left standing amid his memories
Epsilon does not follow him
Don’t you think it would make more sense if you stacked them facing the other way
What
You know likeinstead of long ways if you stacked them vertically
And why would I want to do that
So that you could fit more on the shelves dumbass
I can’t see them all that way
But
Epsilon stay out of it alright
Alright alright geez
I’m just saying though
This would go a lot faster if I helped
I know where they’re supposed to go
Well
Most of them
Epsilon I’d really rather you not touch anything
Okay okay
Why don’t you tell me how you really feel
I just did
Fine
Fine
You don’t have to stay you know
I’m fine
Yeah
You’ve said that Wash
Like a hundred times
So then go
I can’t
Not until we come up with a strategy for these things
You told me I just have to stay calm right
So I’ll stay calm
I think that’s a little easier said than done dude
Oh so you think that you’re the one I want to see when I’m stressed out
No but I am the only one who can wall those things back up
Computer program remember
I can do it myself just tell me
Alright enough
A new voice cuts through their bickering and Wash blinks
He is simultaneously sitting on the floor surrounded by his memories and lying in his infirmary bed with Epsilon perched on his nightstand while Dr Grey glares at them both
Wash focuses on her face fighting to stay conscious for what feels like the first time in days
Emily
Her frown melts a little and she reaches down to pat his hand
That’s right
Do you know your name
Mymy name is Agent Washington
My friends call me Wash
It falls from his lips so easily that he knows it sounds rehearsed but Dr Grey just nods
And you know who this is
Wash barely glances over to where she’s gesturing
Epsilon
Bingo Epsilon says
Right
Wash I’m not sure how long you’ll be conscious this time so allow me to speak frankly
Dr Grey takes a breath folding her arms over her chest
The pair of you need to knock it off
Wash and Epsilon frown at each other for a second before staring at her
Huh
Epsilon says blankly
She huffs fiddling with one of Wash’s monitors and turning the screen to them
Look
These are scans of Wash’s brain activity
Okay so what’s your Epsilon trails off squinting at them
Oh
Yes
Oh
What’s oh
Wash asks suspiciously
What does that mean
What it means Dr Grey says spinning the screen around
Is that every time the two of you so much as speak to each other Wash’s stress levels start to increase
His fight or flight response if you will
Epsilon is at once a ball of guilt in his head and Wash frowns a little
Everything’s fine though
The nanobots are contained and I don’t feel stressed
Well
I do but Dr Grey smiles at him
Wash just because these monitors here she gives them a little tap aren’t going haywire doesn’t mean that everything’s fine
The changes may be minute but that doesn’t mean that they aren’t dangerous
She’s right Epsilon says
He fiddles with his gauntlets before dropping his hands with a sigh
Sorry
Look it’s just this is just weird alright
I’m sure it is Dr Grey says and she does sound sympathetic
I know this can’t be easy for either one of you but
Wash I trust Epsilon has explained to you how vital it is for you to remain calm
Yeah Wash says
Yeah II understand
Good Dr Grey says briskly
Epsilon
Do you
Yup Epsilon says
Read you loud and clear
No arguing
No speaking to each other at all Dr Grey says sternly if you can’t keep it civil
Alright the two of them mutter in unison and Epsilon’s guilt intensifies
It’s too difficult to look at Epsilon so Wash closes his eyes but he cannot escape him cannot leave the presence in his mind cannot even get up and walk out of this hospital room
He turns once more to his scattered memories instead
Waking up out of the fog in his head isn’t easy
He falls several times during his attempted ascent back to consciousness and although Epsilon stays close he knows better than to try to help Wash
The air seems to grow thicker and more restricting the closer that he gets to the light
It wraps around his throat fogs his eyes blocks all sound from his ears he’ll be trapped here forever forever forever
Good morning sleeping beauty
Wash cracks a single eye open squinting in the bright light
For a moment he can swear that he’s in the middle of an open field all blue skies and fresh air before realizing that he’s in the infirmary Tucker peering into his face
The look on Tucker’s face is neither expectant or alarmed as he waits for Wash to wake up fully and for a while Wash simply breathes focusing on the softness of his eyes and the firm press of Tucker’s in his own
It takes nearly five minutes for him to remember how to speak and Tucker says nothing just taps his fingers against Wash’s palm and hums an absent-minded tune
Hi Wash finally whispers and then frowns startled by just how weak his voice sounds
How long About two days Tucker says his fingers now tracing patterns on Wash’s wrist
Two
He half-turns to Epsilon frowning
You didn’t tell me What that it’d been that long
Epsilon’s back in his armor now that he’s projected in the real world but Wash can still picture the eye roll
Uh does it fucking matter
You were kind of busy
I mean understandably
Busy
Obviously
Tucker tilts his head curiously at that but all he says is You did just have brain surgery you know
Something about the phrase sticks in Wash’s head and he frowns at Tucker
I did
Well yeah But Ithese things are still in my head
Tucker’s face looks slightly alarmed at this as if he’s let something slip he wasn’t supposed to but before Wash can think too hard on it he falls into a restless sleep once more
Wash thinks he wakes up several more times to Tucker to Dr Grey to the Reds to Carolina’s hand over his but he’s half-convinced that it is all still a dream
The next time he can stay awake he looks up to see Dr Grey standing at the foot of his bed
How are you feeling
Full he says
It’s a little easier to stay conscious now and his words come a bit stronger
My head
It feels full
I imagine it does she says coming around to the side of his bed and shooing Tucker out of the way
Can you tell me your name
My name is Agent Washington
My friends call me Wash
Do you know my name
Emily he says and there’s an almost undetectable tightening around her eyes
Emily Grey
And do you know where you are
Armonia
She nods pleased
Good Wash very good
Follow my finger
He does
Dr Grey runs through a series of other medical tests running her medical scanner over him and checking his implantation site
Well she says stepping back
I must say Wash you are remarkably lucid considering the surgery you just underwent
Are you in any pain
He knows that none of them miss the way his eyes flick to Tucker hesitating
It’s okay Tucker says
He squeezes Wash’s feet
Don’t worry about me
Wash nods looking back at Dr Grey
Yes
But it’s it’s more like a pressure than a pain
Heavy
And what about the
Aren’t you going to ask me what happened
Dr Grey stops speaking and regards him for a moment before sitting carefully in Tucker’s vacated chair
Wash
I just thought you would Wash says trying to keep his voice casual
Ask me I mean
You haven’t and Ithought you would want me to talk about it
I’m going to Dr Grey says softly
And I would like for you to be as honest with me as you can butnot yet
For now Epsilon has told us enough and I don’t want to push you
Okay Wash says slowly
Why
Dr Grey hesitates then glances at Tucker
Tucker would you give us a moment
Tucker doesn’t look happy about this in the slightest but he nods glancing at Wash
I’ll be right outside the door okay
Okay Wash says and with a final squeeze of his hand Tucker leaves
You know that the nanobots are still inside your brain Dr Grey says
It’s more of a statement than a question but Wash nods anyway and she continues
Yeah
They’re still behind the wall that Epsilon built
Good
That’s good
Dr Grey squares her shoulders and looks at him
Wash it is vital that they stay there
The slightest elevation in your blood pressure the most minute spike in your heartbeat any of that could cause them to break free
I just have to stay calm Wash says echoing Epsilon’s words from after he first deactivated them
Yeah
You’ve told me this already
And I’m telling you again because that’s how vital it is Dr Grey says
It isn’t just a matter of you avoiding stress or fear
You cannot even consider exercising or even any sort of sexual intimacy with Tucker
Alright alright Wash says hastily
We don’t need to get into the specifics
Even you leaving this bed without my knowledge could be disastrous
Okay Wash says
I get it
Dr Grey nods
Good
It’s why I don’t want to go into too much detail about what happened during your captivity just yet as I am sure those memories are very upsetting to you
For now I just want you to understand that you are safe and
And bedridden Wash says dully
Tucker’s words about his brain surgery come rushing back and Wash decides to cut the chase
You operated on me and couldn’t get them out could you
Dr Grey sets her jaw before dropping all pretense as well
No
I couldn’t
Soso I just stay bedridden for the rest of my life
Of course not silly Dr Grey says
I just haven’t gotten them out yet
Wash’s spirits lift slightly at the confident look on her face
So you do know how to
Oh yes she says calmly
I know precisely how to get those things out of your brain
So thenwell what’s the problem he eyes her
I know there’s a problem
You’re not telling me something
The problem she says with a sigh
Is that it’s a two-person surgery
Wash frowns a little
You need an assistant
Can’tcan’t Pickles or Sarge
No I don’t need an assistant
I need another neurosurgeon
We don’t have another neurosurgeon
Well Dr Grey says slowly
We do actually
He just isn’t here
Andwhere is he
The outskirts of the planet
Dr Grey opens her datapad suddenly pulling up a map and showing him a map
Right about here
He was something of a freelance surgeon bouncing around between the two armies before leaving to help the villages who had no medical attention
We worked together for a time
Never saw hands like his unless I was looking at my ownanyway
He even has experience working with hardware in a human brain
I’ve put a message out to him and he’s on his way to Armonia
Soso what you’re saying Wash says sitting up a little straighter
What you’re saying is that someone else is going to be performing brain surgery on me
On my implants
What I’m saying is that Alexander and I are going to be performing the surgery on you she corrects
Together
Why
Whywhat
Why well two things actually
Why is someone who has experience working with neural implants on Chorus
And why is he interested in coming here to operate on my head
He’s coming because he’s my friend and I asked him
When Wash raises an eyebrow she relents a little
And because he can’t resist a case like yours
No neurosurgeon could
As for why he’s on Chorus I have no idea
You have no idea
He’s your friend and you have no idea why someone so talented is on this planet
She narrows her eyes at him
I am equally as talented and I am on this planet
That’s different
How so
Because because you made it sound as if this guy just appeared one day and started helping out
Well That’s what happened isn’t it
Wellyes
It is
And you don’t find this suspicious
Dr Grey shrugged
I didn’t much care to be quite honest
He was a doctor and we needed him
We were grateful for the help
And now you want him to come help operate on me
Wash
What if I say no
’ Dr Grey sighs folding her arms across her chest
You mean if you refuse this surgery
If you refuse to let us both operate
Is that what you’re saying
That’s exactly what I’m saying
Wash says
Wash I of course I’m not going to force any sort of surgery on you that you don’t consent to particularly not one as invasive as this
But I need you to understand that if you refuse it you will die
I know he says surprised
I’m not worried about that
I’m worried about someone else being allowed to play in my head before it happens
He realizes even as the words leave his mouth that he’s said the wrong thing and Dr Grey freezes setting her datapad down on Wash’s nightstand with a slap
What did you just say
I didn’t mean it likethat
I’m curious how you did mean it Dr Grey says her voice calm and measured
Because it sounds to me like you’re fully aware that you might die and you’re okay with this
Well
Wash Dr Grey says in a way that makes Wash suspect she’s struggling to keep her voice level
Don’t you dare give up on yourself
I’m not Wash protests
I’m justtrying to be prepared
For what
This surgery
Or your inevitable death on the operating table
Emily I know you’ll do everything in your power to pull this off but Wash stop it she says sharply
I cannot go into this surgery thinking you aren’t going to fight as hard as you possibly can
I’ll fight Wash says quickly
Trust me I’ll fight
It would kill them if I didn’t
Them
Tucker and Caboose Wash says
Carolina
The Reds
They risked their lives for me and II can’t let that be in vain
Dr Grey pauses looking at him thoughtfully for a moment as if she’s choosing her next words carefully
It’s lovely that you want to fight for your friends she finally says but Washyou need to fight for yourself too
Oh
The silence sits a moment too long before Wash nods
Oh okay
No
I know that
I will
I’ll fight
Dr Grey looks as if she wants to say something else but she doesn’t just purses her lips together and nods
Wash closes his head for a moment trying to quell the rising pressure in his head
After a moment it subsides
I still don’t like it
Someone else in my head
I don’t like it either she says
Not one little bit
Believe me I would love nothing more than to take care of this myself but She trails off glancing for a moment out the window
I need help she says finally
Sometimes we all need a little help
Wash wants to argue further but he bites his tongue fully aware of just how difficult it must have been for her to reach this conclusion
Okay he says
If you think this is best thenokay
You’ll consent to this surgery
Wash nods
Justjust get these things out of my head
Okay
Her hand finds his and squeezes hard
I swear she says solemnly
I swear it
Thank you
She stands then
He should arrive in two days
Until then she smiles
Well I’m sure Tucker would like to see you
I think five minutes apart is a bit much for him
Wash tries to keep the moony smile off his face at that fails miserably and gives it up
The mere thought of Tucker fills him with warmth and although he was in unbearable pain and nearly unconscious at the time he knows that he will not soon be forgetting the way Tucker had lifted him off that gurney and carried him away from that awful room
Had carried him to safety
Had carried him home
That stupid grin is still on his face when Tucker walks in but Tucker just takes a seat and says So you’re cool with ‘the Architect’ he draws little air quotes with his fingers operating on you
I don’t really have a choice Wash says and then lifts an eyebrow
Wait the Architect
Tucker rolls his eyes
Apparently that’s what he calls himself
Or what everyone else calls him
Whatever
He sounds like a tool if you ask me
Oh please Epsilon says popping up to join the conversation
Like you wouldn’t give yourself a nickname if you were some hotshot surgeon
Well I would but it would be cool not douchey 
Oh really
And just what would this super cool nickname be
They lapse into an argument and Wash settles back against his pillows listening to the familiar sounds
He does not focus on the way Epsilon keeps looking over at him or the anxious ball of energy that hums in his mind
Wash spends the next two days in bed leaving only to use the bathroom and take a few laps around his room
Dr Grey is always watching him like a hawk during these moments and he is winded far too easily but Wash revels in the simple freedom of having control over his own muscles
He’ll never take it for granted again
The sim troopers and Carolina are the only ones who come to visit him although to hear the Reds tell it it isn’t for lack of trying
Have to drag about two dozen cadets down the hall an hour
Sarge grumbles
You’d think we had some actor from that show they’re always watching
Anatomy Grey or some similar hogwash
¿Estas hablando de Grey’s Anatomy
Lopez mutters
¿La programa que siempre estas viendo
Exactly Lopez
Nothing short of trivialities and trash anyway you’d think we had some hotshot action star instead of an ugly Blue sleeping the days away
Anyway Grif says loudly
Moving on to something more interesting Oh please Simmons scoffs
Like you’re not the first in line to watch that stupid show
Stupid show
Stupid show
Who was the one crying last week when what’s her face died
Her name was Dr Jasmine Lotoya and she was an icon
The conversation stays light and inconsequential and Wash lets them keep it that way
There is a part of him a very large part that wants to tell them that he gets it the way they have all been standing guard outside of his hospital room keeping anyway from seeing him in his weakened state but he knows full well that would be the fastest way to get every single of Red Team save Donut to shut down
Fucking Blue Team always crying and having group hugs and slumber parties and shit Grif had mumbled the first time he’d stomped into Wash’s hospital room to find Caboose and Tucker conked out in chairs at Wash’s side
Tucker had argued vehemently against this statement but Wash can’t really deny that it is based in some truth
We should have you guys guarding the city walls Wash says instead
No one would get passed you all
Damn straight Donut says proudly and he gently pats Wash’s hands
Wash wakes silently that night mouth falling open in a gasp that never leaves him
He clutches the sheets in his hands glancing around wildly
The monitors
The beds
Tucker and Caboose sound asleep on the beds next to his
And Epsilon thrumming with an anxious exhaustion in his head
You okay he asks Wash cautiously
Wash frowns trying to remember just what it was that woke him
It hadn’t been a dream but rather the beginnings of one mere fingers of a nightmare that had been severed before they could grab hold of him
It’s this more than anything that has Wash straightening up in bed
He should be having nightmares
He should absolutely be having nightmares from what happened to him and he’s not and because of it he can’t sleep
You’re doing something he says suddenly to Epsilon
To the nightmares
You’re stopping them
Epsilon throws him an unimpressed look
Of course I’m stopping them
Well don’t Wash snaps
I don’t want you interfering in my head
Wash Epsilon says calmly
You can’t have nightmares like this right now
Okay
You just can’t
Your brain cannot handle it
Just let me do this
I hate it
Look Epsilon says tiredly
Let’s just deal with it later okay
Dr Grey’s right
You don’t need to think about it
Neither do I come to that
Epsilon tries to hide the wave of anger that courses through him but Wash catches it anyway and looks at him surprised
Oh come on Epsilon says when he notices Wash staring
Who could watch this bullshit and not want to tear those fuckers limb from limb
It’s fine Wash says automatically
I’m fine
Epsilon tilts his head suspiciously but all he says is You should get some sleep
You should go back to Carolina
I can’t
Epsilon
I mean I will obviously I just not yet
Okay
Why
Epsilon sighs loudly
Wash you know why
He supposes he does
He supposes that it would be pretty shitty if after everything his team went through to get him back he kicked it now
He supposes that Epsilon doesn’t want to see his handiwork undone
He supposes
Oh my God Wash that’s not why
Wash startles out of his thoughts glancing at Epsilon 
What
Epsilon huffs glancing between him and Tucker who’s dead asleep in a nearby hospital bed
You’re an idiot he says finally
I’m what
I said you’re an idiot Epsilon groans flopping back on Wash’s nightstand and throwing an arm dramatically over his visor
The biggest fucking idiot I’ve ever
Epsilon
I’m gonna go back to Carolina alright
Obviously
I just
The stab of jealously is so potent and unexpected that Wash doesn’t have time to hide it
There’s an awful endless groan like the creaking of glass and metal and they both glance over inward in alarm towards where the nanobots are concealed
Wash Epsilon says calmly
Look just just breathe or some shit okay
I am breathing Wash snaps but even as he does he wonders just how many times Epsilon has to tell Carolina to breathe
The glass cylinder shudders again the faintest cracking sound splitting the air like a gunshot and Wash sits back heavily clutching at his head
Silence falls and Wash breathes in deep letting the minutes tick by as Epsilon leans against the wall running his hands repeatedly through his hair
Nearly five minutes pass and Epsilon finally leans forward
Look
Don’t Wash says abruptly
Just don’t
I don’t want to talk about Freelancer
Okay
He thinks about it anyway memories that he has yet to box up flickering past his eyes of those few days when Epsilon had been his AI
; days that he rarely allowed himself to think about anymore
Lost days
Meaningless days days when he wasn’t good enough or strong enough
Dude come on it wasn’t like that
Wash groans
I really really wish you weren’t in my head right now
That makes two of us
So go
I will Epsilons says but he doesn’t and they’re back to square one
You’re still here
Of course I’m still here
God you’re so fucking dense you know that
So goddamn stubborn
Epsilon just
Wash takes a breath
Let’s just stop
Okay
He doesn’t speak again through the night and neither does Epsilon but they sit there in silence until Wash falls asleep once more
Wash wakes to find Carolina sitting at his bedside helmet in her lap with Epsilon perched on top of it
She sets it aside when she notices Wash watching them standing abruptly
Wash
He’s seen her several times since his arrival back in Armonia but always surrounded by the others
It hasn’t been the two of them yet and Wash is struck by a powerful sense of déjà vu waking up in Freelancer to a mind heavy and loopy with drugs and Carolina standing at his bedside
Hey boss
When he reaches for her hand she slips it in his squeezing
You just missed Tucker
Epsilon and I are taking bets on how quickly he’ll be back
Wash grins as Epsilon grunts in assent
What does the winner get
Carolina’s half-smile is fading now as she looks at him
The doctor is here
I’m supposed to let them know when you’re awake
Well Wash sits up a little straighter smoothing his hands over the sheets
I’m up solet’s call him in I guess
Carolina doesn’t move
We don’t have to
What
The doctor
We don’tWash you don’t have to do this if you don’t want to
Uh yes he does Epsilon mutters and she shoots him a fierce glare
What
He does
He does if he wants to live
I don’t like it Carolina says and Wash suddenly suspects that they’d already had this argument while he was sleeping
We don’t even know if this is going to work
Carolina Wash sighs
If I had any choice then I wouldn’t be doing this
But I don’t and he’s here solet’s just call him in and get it over with
Carolina nods putting a hand to her helmet just as Tucker walks in the room
You’re awake he says taking a seat on Wash’s bed and putting a hand to Wash’s head as if he’s taking his temperature
Feeling okay in there
I’m okay he says automatically
Little full butI’m okay
They’re on their way Carolina says letting a hand fall from her helmet’s radio dial
Along with all the Reds and Caboose of course
Of course Wash says wryly but his spirits lift slightly all the same
It isn’t long before there are footsteps down the hall the chatter of voices growing louder and louder
A strange and unexpected tension locks up his bones and Wash turns to Epsilon who has his head canted towards the door and has gone so utterly still that Wash thinks he might have frozen
Epsilon what’s wrong
Epsilon does not answer
The footsteps grow louder until the door is swinging open and
Panic
Wash’s head is suddenly abuzz with panic and he grips at the sheets before realizing that it’s not his own
It’s been so long since he’s experienced the sensation of someone else panicking inside his head that he’d almost forgotten what it felt like
A memory is pulled unbidden to the front of his surface of Epsilon’s disastrous implantation into his neural interface
Wash is on the floor screaming the bewildered voices of the doctors barely distinguishable over Allison’s there are hands on his shoulders and a voice screaming Secure him as Wash slams his hands into the ground and tries not to be sick and Epsilon screams and screams and screams
Something in his head burns sharp and sudden a fault line appearing in the glass that conceals the nanobots
Breathe
He must breathe must be calm and still must not let the class crack further
Tucker’s eyebrows furrow in concern as Wash puts a hand to his chest inhaling long and deep
Wash
You okay
Yeah Wash says distantly
Yeah I’m He’s half-turning to where he can see Epsilon glitching in his peripheral when he catches sight of the man in the doorway for the first time and familiarity hits him so hard it leaves him breathless once more
Good afternoon Agent
The doctor hesitates glancing down at his clipboard
Washington he finishes after a moment of silence that stretches on too long
I am the Doctor of Project Freelancer
Epsilon’s hologram shatters into bits of blue but Wash can still feel his panic
Wash shoves it hard to the back of his mind and half climbs out of his bed Tucker’s hand on his arm the only thing keeping him back
He says something something low and concerned but Wash does not hear him does not look at him
He has eyes for no one else in the room because because
Oh my God he whispers voice strangled
Tronosky
The doctor’s eyes are wide behind his glasses one hand gripping the doorframe
Agent Washington
The space between them feels both miles wide and entirely too close a strange mixture of claustrophobia and unbearable distance
I thought I’d never see you again Wash says or doesn’t say
You saved my life and I
I thought you were dead they say in unison and Wash shakes his head firmly because he doesn’t understand no one understands
No no you don’t get it I saw you die I saw them kill youFelix killed you But that wasn’t real that wasn’t right they hadn’t killed Tronosky because Tronosky wasn’t on Chorus that room had been fake a sick lie they’d drawn up to make him lose his mind
Looking into his old doctor’s face now Wash thinks it just may have worked
That wasn’t real he mutters
Wash brings his hands up to his temples pressing hard and breathing deep
That that wasn’t real they didn’t kill youdid they
They’d killed someone and they’d killed those two nurses who looked so very like his old aids it nothing made sense it was wrong all wrong Dr Tronosky crosses the room to him clumsy and halting
He stops as Tucker stands up and slams a hand on his chest hard
Whoa whoa whoa
Not another step asshole
I want to know who you are and what the fuck is going on
Wash reaches his hand out passed Tucker and holds tight to Dr Tronosky’s arm struck by an overwhelming desire to make sure that he isn’t a hallucination
The doctor reaches up to cover Wash’s hand with his own and the warmth of his skin is
Real he asks voice cracking head pulsing
You’re you’re real
I’m real Dr Tronosky says stunned
I
Wash is far from convinced but he doesn’t care
He has imagined this moment so many times imagined what he would say if he could see his old doctor again if he were given the chance to say thank you
The moment is here and all of Wash’s words fail him as he lunges forward and pulls the doctor into a fierce hug
Dr Tronosky’s arms come up around him and squeeze tightly and Tucker throws up his hands and says Okay what the fuck is even happening
Wash wants to answer to tell him to explain that this moment real or not is a goddamned miracle but he’s breathing as if he just ran a marathon and his heart is beating so fast inside his chest so fast and suddenly it’s impossible to breath to think to see
Something shatters in his head and he turns his gaze inward to see the glass cylinder that Epsilon had constructed break into millions of pieces and the nanobots tumble free
His body goes limp hands falling from around Dr Tronosky’s shoulders and through the haze he can just barely make out Tucker hauling Dr Tronosky away from him and slamming him up a nearby wall before his vision shakes to black and he sees no more
Wash’s body goes slack and Tucker moves
It is he will realize later the exact opposite of the reaction he’d had when Wash’s radio cut out all those weeks ago when Tucker had been paralyzed by fear and a bone deep knowledge that Wash was gone and that they might never see him again
Wash is not gone now
Wash is here inches away
He is not going anywhere and Tucker will die before he lets anyone else hurt him
A deep reassuring calm drops into the center of Tucker’s skull and he moves faster than anyone in the room faster even than Carolina
He lunges forward grabs the new doctor by the back of his jacket slams him up against the wall and shoves the hilt of his sword so hard against the side of his face that the doctor’s glasses nearly fall off
The monitors by Wash’s bedside start to beep with increasing intensity as he falls shaking to the mattress and in his peripheral Tucker sees Dr Grey scramble to his side
Don’t know if you’ve ever seen one of these before Tucker says pressing the sword hilt harder still against the doctor’s jaw but this is a fucking laser sword
You’ve got five seconds to tell me who the fuck you are and why Wash knows your name before I send it straight through your brain
The bastard Tucker is displeased to see isn’t even looking at him
He’s gazing over Tucker’s shoulder at Wash eyes wide and stunned
Is
Emily is he alright
Check his blood pressure levels
I’m working on it Alexander
And did you
Hey Tucker snaps and he shoves the doctor back harder into the wall
I asked you a fucking question
The doctor finally looks at him bewildered
What
Tucker wants to scream
Who the fuck are you and why shouldn’t I kill you with my laser sword
My name is Doctor Alexander Tronosky the doctor says and you need to let me go now
Uh fat fucking chance of that
Tucker Donut whispers in the background maybe you should ask him these questions later
I’m asking him them now
Why does Wash know your name
Who do you work for
I don’t work for anyone
Did you have something to do with what they did to Wash
Tucker asks
The calm center in his head is starting to pulse pounding with an anger that has his fingers twitching on the sword
Are you working with Charon
Did you do something to his head
Dr Tronosky finally seems to understand that Tucker is not even in the general vicinity of fucking around and his eyes light up with understanding
No
No no nothing like that
I do know Wash but it wasn’t from his time in captivity let me explain
Wait a minute Carolina says slowly
She appears on Tucker’s left side head tilted
I know you
I imagine that you do
Dr Tronosky nods his head at Tucker as best he’s able with the sword jammed up under his chin
In fact I imagine that most of you do
Tucker furrows his eyebrows
What
I don’t know you I’ve never seen you before in my life
Even as he says it he knows it’s not true
There’s something in the very back of his brain trying to shove its way forward something that stirred when he heard the name Tronosky he knows that name but from where and why
A few heartbeats of silence pass the only sounds coming from the monitors and Dr Grey’s muttered instructions to Dr Pickles
Dr Tronosky is watching them impatiently
Look I was the
Freelancer Carolina says suddenly
You were the doctor who wired us all for our implants in Freelancer
There’s a flash of red on Tucker’s other side as Sarge shoves his face right up near Dr Tronosky’s
Huh
Well I’ll be damned
He is
Tucker doesn’t turn around but he can practically feel a release of tension in the room and Donut even mutters an Oh thank goodness
What guys
Come on
This isn’t any better
Tucker sputters
This whole thing is his fault in the first place
But Tucker don’t you see
Donut asks earnestly
If he’s the one who wired the implants he’s the best chance we’ve got to help fix Wash
Wash wouldn’t need to be fixed if he didn’t have these fucking wires in his head
Tucker glares at the doctor
What are you even doing here on this planet
A question that I myself would love to hear the answer to Dr Grey says as well as why you didn’t tell me that you worked for Freelancer
Dr Tronosky sighs
Emily I couldn’t
Yes yes I know tragic past aura of mystery et cetera et cetera right now I don’t care
Right now I need you to come help me fix my patient
Tucker let him go
Tucker grinds his teeth together
No
Tucker
I said no
Look did no one else see the way Wash reacted when this fucker walked into the room
Did everyone miss the part where Church noped the fuck out
I’m not letting him within ten fucking feet of Wash
Listen
Tucker right
I’m not going to hurt him
Bullshit
What possible reason could I have for wanting to hurt Wash
Dr Tronosky snaps
In a room full of all of hishis friends no less
Gee I don’t know Tucker says sarcastically
What possible reason could you have for helping to put all of this shit in everyone’s heads in the first place
I’m not proud of what I did
I don’t give a shit about your secret pain
Enough
Dr Grey cries
Tucker let him down
Alexander get over here now
We need to get him into surgery immediately
Pickles wheel me that stretcher please
Tucker
Now
NO
Tucker shouts
He tightens his grip on his sword
No
I’m not letting him get in there and fuck up Wash’s head
I’m not letting anyone hurt Wash not while I’m fucking standing right here
I won’t
I wouldn’t hurt Wash Dr Tronosky protests
I wouldn’t
You already fucking did
This is your fault why did he react that way when you walked in
Huh
It’s been a long time a very long time since we’ve last seen each other and the circumstances in which were did were less than ideal
You mean when you were shoving a rampant AI fragment into his head
No Dr Tronosky snaps When I was operating on him in Recovery after the ship crashed They threw you out Carolina says suddenly
She hasn’t moved from Tucker’s side
Of the hospital
Didn’t they
Yes how did you
Enough
Tucker freezes as there’s something sharp pressed to the side of his neck and Dr Grey’s voice rings in his ear
Tucker you have five seconds to let the doctor go or I’ll make sure you don’t wake up for the rest of the day
It’s a syringe Tucker realizes a syringe filled with God knows what that she’s got pressed to the side of his neck
I can’t what if he fucks up what if you’re wrong
I’m not wrong Dr Grey says
Tucker I don’t want to hurt you but I will if it means saving Wash’s life
But
Five
You can’t just
Four
Come on
Three
What if
Two
Tucker steps back cursing fluently and Dr Grey wastes no time in yanking Dr Tronosky over to Wash
I’m coming with you
Dr Grey doesn’t look at him
You most certainly are not
You know the rule
No loved ones allowed in the operating room
But
Tucker casts his eyes around desperately
Sarge
Sarge can go in there with you right
He knows medical shit
Might not be a bad idea Sarge says
He eyes Dr Tronosky
I trust your judgment darlin’ but might not hurt to have an extra set of hands and a fully loaded shotgun in there
Fine Dr Grey snaps as they lift Wash onto the stretcher
Fine but you need to scrub in no armor
And you’ll protect them right
Tucker persists looking at Sarge
You’ll protect Wash and Dr Grey and and Pickles if this asshole turns out to be a nutter
As the interim leader of Blue Team
Oh my God and devoted lover to this fair lady here I will do my duty Sarge says grandly before sweeping out of the room to presumably scrub up
Dr Grey eyes Tucker suspiciously as he approaches the stretcher but he only takes Wash’s hand as they push through the doors and set a brisk pace towards the ICU
Wash’s whole body is shaking face twisted in pain and Tucker gives his fingers a firm squeeze
Hey
You’re gonna be okay
You hear me
If you kick it after all of this I swear to God I’m gonna
Tucker we’ve arrived
I’m sorry but you have to stay here
Tucker blinks looking up at the ICU doors
I right fine
He glances down once more at Wash then bends down pressing their foreheads together briefly
If you leave me I’m gonna be real fucking pissed
Okay
Don’t don’t leave me
Please
He lets Wash’s hand fall from his own as they push the stretcher forward grabbing hold of Dr Tronosky’s lab coat once more
If you hurt him I’ll kill you
Dr Tronosky looks at him appraisingly
Yesyes I believe you will
He pulls out of Tucker’s grasp and Tucker blinks after him wondering just why the doctor sounds so fucking happy about it
Carolina’s hand fastens around Tucker’s arm as he makes to follow them automatically
You heard her Tucker
Tucker tries to shrug her hand off but she just tightens her grip
How can you be okay with this
I’m not okay with this Carolina snaps
Nothing about this is okay but
Tucker I don’t think he’s going to hurt Wash
You don’t know that
No I don’t she says
But
Freelancer ruined everyone’s lives including his
Oh my God I don’t care
Tex found him
What
Carolina sighs taking a seat on the bench and unsealing her helmet
After Freelancer
After the ship crashed
I was keeping tabs on everyone and I know she found him
So fucking what
So Carolina says she found him and she didn’t kill him
The so what is on Tucker’s tongue once more but he bites it back
He takes a seat next to Carolina instead
She didn’t
No
I don’t know why or what they talked about but
I don’t think she would’ve let him walk away for no reason
Not afterwell
Not after what they did to Alpha or to her
Tucker wants to argue but he can’t quite find it in him to do so
Donut appears once more
Tucker hadn’t even noticed him leave with a basket of sandwiches apples and
Is that hot chocolate
Where did you even get that
It sure is Donut says pressing a thermos and sandwich into his hands
And never you mind where I got it
Now drink up
There’s a dangerous look in Donut’s eyes that warns Tucker not to argue so he takes a dutiful bite out of his sandwich
Thanks Donut
The three of them sit there in silence until Caboose Grif and Simmons come down the hallway
Donut swats Grif’s hands away as he reaches for Tucker’s half-eaten sandwich
Grif
You just had lunch
So
He’s not going to eat that
Yes he is Donut says fiercely and Tucker hastens to take another few bites of his sandwich
Where’s Sarge
Simmons asks
Sarge Tucker says taking a vicious bite of his apple is in there making sure the new wonder surgeon doesn’t fuck up Wash’s brain
There’s a moment of silence in which everyone exchanges looks
Tucker watches Donut Grif and Simmons have a full conversation consisting of nothing but eyebrow raises and shrugs before Grif says Wait why don’t we like this new doctor
Because he’s the one who wired our brains with these fucking implants
It doesn’t quite have the dramatic effect he hoped for although Simmons does raise his eyebrows and say Wait Dr Tronosky
Bingo
How Grif asks the ceiling how do you remember his name
He performed brain surgery on us Grif
Yeah like a hundred years ago
I remember the nice doctor man Caboose says serenely
He did not get angry when I asked him a lot of questions
I’m glad he is helping fix Wash
Tucker throws up his hands nearly upending his thermos of hot chocolate in the process
Am I the only one who has a problem with this
Probably Grif says throwing himself down on the bench and eyeing their food imploringly
Carolina rolls her eyes and to Donut’s dismay tears off a chunk of her sandwich to hand to Grif
Really though why are your panties in a knot about this exactly
My panties are in a knot because Wash’s heart rate went like through the fucking roof when that dude walked into the room
Which is the exact opposite of what was supposed to happen
Wash was supposed to be staying calm
How does it makes sense that a guy who made him panic is operating on his head
But he didn’t panic Donut insists
He was just surprised
I thought the two of them looked happy to see each other
Oh they did not
They did
Donut pauses
Wash hugged him Tucker
Don’t forget that part
Wash doesn’t just go around hugging people you know
Tucker sighs leaning back against the wall and trying to remember every detail
Wash’s eyes had gone wide and he’d half risen from the bed and he’d said the doctor’s name
Shocked
He had sounded shocked
It sounds to me like we couldn’t have asked for someone better to operate on Wash Simmons said hesitantly eyeing Tucker
When Tucker doesn’t contradict him he continues voice stronger
I mean no one knows these implants better he invented them after all
Wait he did
Well yeah Simmons says
I mean not neural implants in general but he invented the type that all Freelancer personal were equipped with
He’s done hundreds and hundreds of implantations
Simmons would know Grif interjects
He probably asked the doctor to recount every single one of them for some boring research project
Shut up Grif Simmons snaps
The point is if anyone can help Dr Grey fix this it’s him
I don’t like it Tucker says finally
I don’t trust him
You don’t have to trust him Donut says gently
You just have to let him do his job
Well we don’t have much of a choice do we
They all sigh glancing as one at the door
No Carolina says her tone accepting though certainly not happy
We don’t
The hours stretch on
Britton and Kennedy show up again not long into Wash’s surgery with a fair amount of the other cadets trailing behind
Jensen throws her arms around Simmons and doesn’t let go for a long time Palomo starts crying and Bitters cracks inappropriate jokes until Prajapati shoves him into a wall
It’s a mess but Tucker is grateful for their company and noise
Kimball appears a little while later and sits with them as Carolina fills her in on the way Wash had reacted towards the doctor
Yes Tronosky did stay with us for quite some time Kimball says
Her eyes find Tucker’s
Wash is safe with him Tucker
He saved many of our lives time and time again and asked for nothing in return
I don’t believe he has any reason to hurt Wash
Tucker still doesn’t entirely buy it but he merely gives a terse nod
None of you cared that he was clearly working for both sides
Carolina asks with a frown
Maybe he didn’t hurt any of you but he could have he could have been a plant by the Feds and injected you all with a deadly virus
Tucker decides that Carolina has been spending entirely too much times with the Reds
Thanks Carolina
Yeah way to lighten the mood Grif mutters shooting a pointed look at Tucker
Carolina folds her arms across her chest
Tucker’s concerns are hardly unwarranted
I thought you said you didn’t think he’d hurt Wash Tucker accuses
I don’t I’m just she turns back to Kimball
I want to know what it was about this man that made you all trust him
We didn’t have a choice
They turn to see Perry approaching followed by Patil and a handful of Fed soldiers
He was too good Patil adds
Couldn’t refuse that kind of help
Kimball nods
Exactly
We were losing soldiers left and right we weren’t exactly in a position to refuse medical aid especially from someone like him
I still don’t understand what he was doing here in the first place Tucker can’t resist adding
I mean if this guy was so good why was he on Chorus
How did he even get here
He was hiding Carolina says surprised
She raises her eyebrows when they all turn to look at her
I thought that was the obvious part
It’s what I was doing for years before I found you all
Staying under the radar
But it doesn’t sound like he was staying under the radar Simmons says
I mean staying under the radar would be doing well what you were doing
Dr Tronosky got himself involved in the middle of a civil war and made no secrets about his abilities
So why the good Samaritan act
Tucker adds
Why draw all that attention to himself
I think Carolina says slowly
That he probably wanted to make things better
To try to set them right
Make up for what he had done somehow
Make up for what
Tucker snaps
Wiring you guys with crazy AI s
She levels him with an exasperated glare
Something like that yes
I like him Britton pipes up
She’s sitting on the ground fiddling with her long blonde hair attempting to wrest it into a ponytail with one arm
I don’t think he’s going to hurt Wash
Prajapati rolls her eyes
You don’t think anyone is going to hurt anyone BB
She snatches the hair tie out of Britton’s hand and gathers hair back starting a French braid on the top of her head
I agree though
He’ll fix Wash’s head
What Britton hesitates exchanging significant eye contact with Kennedy
What exactly happened to his head anyway
Prajapati makes a shushing noise flicking Britton on the back of her head
Ow
Oh please like you weren’t all thinking it
We are all trying to lay low Prajapati hisses
Asking nosy questions is not laying low BB
How about Kimball says loudly you all focus on helping Wash get better however he needs whether that means staying out of the way or behaving when he’s back to training and not worry about the specifics of his injuries
That reminds me Carolina says suddenly Va
Kimball
His armor
We were unable to retrieve his armor
He’ll need a new set
Do you have something
Of course Kimball says
There’s
What
Jensen blurts
She looks nothing short of horrified
Agent Washington doesn’t have his armor
Look it was all we could do to get out of there alive Grif says
We couldn’t exactly stick around to get his armor
Again Tucker says rolling his eyes at the ceiling I’d like to point out that you weren’t there you were flying the fucking plane
The most important job of all Britton says reverently looking at Grif who immediately puffs up his chest
The point is Kimball says hastily over Tucker’s loud scoffing noise the point is we have plenty of extra suits of armor that Agent Washington is welcome to choose from
Scraps Jensen says
We have scraps of armor
You can’t give one of those suits to Agent Washington
Uh why not
Grif asks
Because they suck Bitters says
He shrugs when Kimball glares at him
What
They do
Seems kind of shitty for him to go from Freelancer armor to our tin-can suits
Not to mention the color palettes are simply horrid
Donut exclaims
The angles are just all wrong
And none of them are blue Caboose says sulkily
Wash’s armor was blue
There’s a pause as everyone thinks back
Agent Washington’s armor was grey Palomo says glancing around
Wasn’t it
It was blue Caboose says staunchly his voice taking on that fucking stubborn lilt that it always does before a meltdown
Wash’s armor was blue
It was blue under the grey Tucker interjects quickly
He
With yellow pieces Caboose reminds him snootily
With yellow pieces that I painted for him
Yes yes with yellow pieces Tucker adds rolling his eyes
Caboose stop fucking whining
You can paint his armor blue again what’s the problem
The problem is that Agent Washington deserves better armor than what we’ve got Jensen says
She actually looks as if she might cry and Britton is already there wiping at her eyes in what she clearly thinks is a subtle manner
Jesus Christ Grif grumps
It’s just armor for
He stops speaking as the door swings open and Dr Grey emerges tugging her mask down away from her mouth
She holds up her hands as half the hallway stands
He’s stable
Questions later
I’m breaking one of my rules and Tucker I need you to come with me
Tucker swallows hard as every eye in the hallway turns to him
Me
Yes
She glances back at the door clearly eager to get back to work and Tucker narrows his eyes suspiciously
Did you leave him alone in there
Sarge is with him she says impatiently already shuffling towards the door once more
We don’t have time for this
Tucker
I need your help
Okay Tucker says and he takes a few steps forward
What do you need me to do
The next part of this surgery requires Agent Washington to be awake she says
We can’t find a way around it
He will be very disoriented when I wake him up and may start to panic
I need someone to sit with him and talk to him to help keep him calm
Oh Tucker says
Andand you need me
There’s a series of exasperated huffs and groans from behind him
You’re his lover silly Britton whispers loudly
You have to go sit with him
Oh my God Kennedy breathes it’s just like a movie
It’s science Dr Grey says crisply and they all stare at her blankly save for Britton who nods as if this makes perfect sense
Wash’s brain settles down when he thinks of Tucker Britton explains and she places a reverent hand over her heart
That’s why you need him right
Oh it’s so romantic Precisely
Epsilon’s been mapping the surgery and he says Tucker’s the best chance we’ve got
Dr Grey sighs
Believe me the last thing I want is to wake him up but it’s imperative that we determine his lucidity while we fix his implants
Oh Tucker says
Oh uh
Yeah of course
Lead the way
She leads him through the ICU doors and into a small room
There’s a pair of fresh scrubs set out on the bench
Take off your armor and your suit wash your hands thoroughly three minutes and make sure all of that hair is in a scrub cap
Tucker follows her instructions mechanically and heads into the infirmary
Wash is propped up in some sort of special gurney in what’s almost a sitting position eyes closed with Dr Grey and Dr Tronosky standing at the head of the gurney
Sarge is standing at Wash’s side looking entirely out of place in scrubs shotgun slung across his back
Tucker locates Epsilon last standing by Wash’s side speaking in low tones
His voice sounds a bit listless but Tucker is enormously relieved to see that he’s pulled it together somewhat
Have a seat Tucker Dr Grey says
I’m going to wake him up now
Your job is to keep him calm Dr Tronosky says
It might help if you talk about
I know how to keep Wash calm asshole Tucker snaps
He takes a deep breath and gathers one of Wash’s hands into his own
Go on
I’m ready
Tucker is growing used to little rooms that feel like nightmares rooms of bloody needles and hospital beds
He is used to counting his steps through them to breathing tight and sure onetwothree onetwothree
He will never ever get used to this to the way Wash’s face looks when it’s filled with anguish and streaked with tears and sweat on Tucker’s floor when the nightmares hit or bound to a gurney where everything is red or laid out on an operating table with his head split open for the world to see
The hours stretch on and on and on and all Tucker wants to do is run to tear Dr Grey and Tronosky’s hands away from Wash’s implants to rip Epsilon out of his head to grab Wash and go
He thinks Wash wants that too as his eyes lock firmly onto Tucker’s as their hands tighten and squeeze around each other’s as the monitors beep and buzz as the voices of everyone else drone around them
But there is no running from this little room no escape no window to let the light in
There are only the frantic conversations that blur together as the hours drag; there are only the walls at their backs and the corners boxing them in as every one of them holds a breath
This is our last chance
No one says it but they feel it every one of them
Where am I
Chorus
Armonia
You’re safe dude
M’head hurts
I know
Dr Grey and andDr Grey’s just fixing some stuff okay
I don’t want to be here
Neither do I
Wash this might pinch a bit alright
Okay aaarggghhhh God that hurts that hurts
What the fuck
That was a little more than pinch Grey
Tucker
Right sorry
Wash it’s fine you’re finejust ignore thepinch Blue Team
Can’t even handle a little bitty brain surgery
Sarge shut the fuck up and keep that gun on the Architect here where the fuck did you even get red scrubs anyway
Good question
Where did you find red scrubs darling
They’re m’own personal pair
Right How much longer is this going to take
Well goodness me Epsilon I apologize if we’re boring you
Oh shut up that’s not what I meant look this isn’t easy holding these fuckers back alright
Told you
I can do it
Jesus Christ Wash you are on an operating table just let me
Don’t you two start
Yes ma’am
Sorry
Uh oh What
What does that mean uh oh
Nothing nothing
Dr Grey come look at this
I think we’re losing him
Pickles
I’m sorry
It’s just look
"It looks
 those wires look melted
What happened to him
" "Hey asshole maybe let's discuss that later and not you know when his head is open on the fucking table
" Right
 it's just was there fire back here
" "Wow you're just bound and determined to be a-" "It will help me with the next step of the surgery-" "Oh now don't you two start- it's like my operating room is filled with children
Ollie come here and hold this clamp please
Tucker talk to Wash
Right
Right
Jesus Christ
So
Wash
Did I ever tell you about that time No no no
Stay with me come on focus on me just look right here
Tell me tell me your name
I don’t think I remember Yes you fucking do don’t pull that shit on me
Come on
Tell me your name
My name my name isis Agent Washington
It’s Wash
That’s fucking right
Friends call me Wash
You’re goddamn right we do
Now what’s mine
Tucker
Lavernius Tucker
Hm
You should call me that more often
Andand his name is Nope don’t look at him
Don’t look at anyone else
Don’t worry about it
It’s just you and me here yeah
Yeah
Okay
Okay
Dr Grey puts Wash back under slowly and Tucker tries to memorize every speck of blue in those eyes
They grow heavier and heavier until Wash is breathing deep once more and Tucker sits there in silence for the rest of his surgery holding Wash’s hand
He is grateful that no one tells him to leave not only because he wouldn’t but because he couldn’t
His bones feel like jelly heavy with the knowledge that he may have just seen Wash’s eyes close for the last time
We won’t know much more until he wakes up Dr Tronosky says as they close and Tucker doesn’t even have it in him to snap
You got them though he asks Epsilon
The nanobots
You got them
We got them Epsilon says sounding more exhausted than Tucker’s ever heard
We got them but it wasn’t easy
He just has toput a few things back together
Tucker is used to this to the waiting to the little rooms that feel like nightmares
He doesn’t bother to change out of his scrubs when they leave the ICU just plops down in the chair next to Wash’s room in recovery and rests his head on the mattress
He’s getting used to this too sleeping beside hospital beds waking up to Wash’s hand in his hair
Tucker doesn’t look up when Caboose and Carolina enter or when the Reds follow a few minutes later just lets Sarge regale them with tales of the surgery while he holds Wash’s hand and waits and waits and waits
His world moves in circles
For a while Wash lets himself be swept around in them twirling turning twisting
His head feels like water as if he is lying on his back in the waves arms held out to the side
Images float by overhead and snippets of conversations catch in his ears
The sea of memories is nearly suffocating pressing heavy on his chest like a physical weight sights smells sounds sensations crashing together blurry and overwhelming
Wash drags himself to a sit floating floating floating as the endless whirl of color whip by
He stares at his palms upturned in his lap and directs all his focus to them
His hands become solid memories dropping into them like stones
A sugar bowl cold and solid against his palms
The crunch of teeth breaking beneath his knuckles
A brown helmet turned over and over in his hands
Dreaded black hair sliding soft through his fingers
Sensations so many of them trying to slip through his cupped palms like quicksand but he does not let them escape
He takes each one boxes it up carefully and turns to the next one
Methodical
Careful
Wash inhales deep and slow letting that become his next point of focus
The smell of fresh cut wood from a fallen cherry tree
Strong black coffee with plenty of sugar
Hospital antiseptic far too familiar
A clear waterfall
He pauses on the waterfall expanding the memory beyond just its mossy clean smell
A picturesque simulation base unfamiliar blue armor the bickering of his new teammates old worn-in running shoes that somehow fit just right
He’d laced them up to run outside of his armor for the first time in years and let his footsteps carry him up to the base’s waterfall
Wash remembers standing up there for nearly thirty minutes breathing in that gloriously crisp scent and staring into the bright and boundless blue water below him
It had taken him some time to realize that the reason his chest felt so heavy was because it was all so clean the smell the water the base itself
He’d felt indescribably dirty standing there a blight on an otherwise perfect landscape
He did not deserve such a moment of perfect peace did not deserve the two blue-armored soldiers calling him teammate in the distance did not deserve this beautiful clear water
He’d unlaced his running shoes and jumped into it anyway
Wash follows the memory down traces his own descent into the water and gasps as it hits him so cold that it knocks the very breath from his lungs
The memory plays on but Wash keeps falling through the water through the blue until he crashes through
My name is Agent Washington
My friends call me Wash and lands on with his feet on a familiar cracked floor surrounded by rows and rows of cherry shelves each one holding dozens of memories stacked in careful boxes
My name is Wash
He breathes
Wash begins to walk hands trailing along the shiny polished wood fingertips soaking in the pleasant warmth of his boxes
Dark blue light blue green red black and orange
His paces carry him past the glass cylinder cracked down the middle
There is no sign of the nanobots no thick black cloud swirling through his mind
The air is clean and clear though a bit tenuous as if this fragile calm could shatter at any moment
There is still something here that doesn’t belong setting his teeth on edge and Wash knows despite being unable to see him that Epsilon is lingering in his head
But he doesn’t want to think about Epsilon
He turns his attention instead to the voice whispering through his mind familiar in the best ways and although Wash can’t catch the specific words he knows their cadence
He wants to hear them each vowel and consonant wants to tuck each one away in its own little box precious and protected
Wash closes his eyes
He focuses on the whispering words rifling through his hair lets them pull him forward away from his boxes away from the cracked wooden floor away from Epsilon’s presence in his mind
The words roll around him and he climbs over their ridges hauls himself up letter by letter as he hears them form his name Wash
WashWash Wash He opens his eyes in a room full of buzzing beeps and breathes as he has done so many times before
( to a little girl with green eyes to two soldiers in purple armor to a little blue AI on his chest to the UNSC handcuffing him to countless doctors to red and blue soldiers in the snow
) To a warm hand in his to fuzzy dreads tickling his arm and the biggest pair of brown eyes he’s ever seen peering into his own
To
To
Tucker
Tucker’s face always so expressive cracks open in relief breath leaving his parted lips in a whoosh body sagging as he places a steadying hand on the mattress before lifting that same hand to Wash’s face to brush the hair out of his eyes
Wash
There’s a tremble in Tucker’s voice that Wash has never heard before and he knows that he can say that for sure because he remembers he remembers how Tucker says his name when he’s happy or wanting or hurt or scared but this this
Wash Tucker breathes again and he leans forward until his forehead is resting against Wash’s hand sliding down to cup the side of Wash’s face
You in there
Yeah he says his own voice coming strangled
M’in here
Tucker pulls back to look at him hands cradling Wash’s head like it’s made of porcelain
You he says voice reverent scared the living shit out of me
Wash cracks a slight smile at the pure indignation that creeps into Tucker’s tone
How long
How long were you out
Two and a half days
Tucker sighs
I should probably go get Dr Grey
Wash shares the reluctance in his tone
It’s nice here wrapped in this sleepy hazy bubble Tucker’s hands on his face and in his hair anchoring him to consciousness
When Dr Grey comes back in she’s going to ask him questions and eventually she’s going to ask him what happened and Wash will have to tell her
He will have to do this again; he will have to sit in a chair tell his doctor
Doctors
Something must change in his face because Tucker frowns
What
Doctors Wash says and closes his eyes for a moment to drag a memory to the surface his old doctor swaying in the doorway of this very hospital room eyes blown wide with shock
He opens his own eyes uncertain his newfound stable ground suddenly untenable
I thought I saw my old doctor
From Freelancer
You mean the Architect Tucker says sourly and Wash remembers something else now
Tucker hauling the doctor off him and throwing him bodily into the nearest wall
You did dude
Good old Dr Tronosky
Tronosky Wash repeats slowly
But whyhow is he here
I have no idea Tucker says
He pulls back slightly straightening to glance at the door and Wash fastens a hand around his wrist before he can think to stop himself
Did he swallows hastily letting go of Tucker’s arm
They got those things out of my head
Right
That’s what Grey said Tucker assures him and he absently lifts Wash’s hand folding his fingers back around Tucker’s forearm
Why
Are they stilllike in there
No no Wash says quickly
He keeps his hand there this time thumb running along Tucker’s pulse point
They’re gone
I justcan’t believe it
I really thought He trails off Tucker watching him closely
I really thought I wasn’t going to make it
But you did Tucker says
You did make it and you’re here now and it’sit’s gonna be fine
The door opens before Wash can answer although he isn’t sure just what he would’ve said
They both glance up to see Dr Grey who falters several feet into the room
Wash
You’re awake
She hurries over to him medical scanner forgotten for a moment as her fingers fasten automatically around his wrist to check his pulse
Wash cracks another grin at that and she drops his wrist with a huff upon noticing his expression
Don’t you give me that look Agent Washington
Her gaze flicks to Tucker
Tucker
You were supposed to fetch me the moment my patient opened his eyes
I was going to
Tucker protests
He just opened his eyes like two seconds ago
Hmm Dr Grey says but she lets it drop turning on her medical scanner
Well I suppose I’ll just have to take your word for it
Wash how are you
He knows that neither of them miss the way he flinches hard when Dr Grey steps out of his vision to run the scanner over his head knows Tucker does not miss the way Wash’s fingers dig into his wrist
Dr Grey’s voice falters for only a moment and she remains in Wash’s vision as she lifts the scanner more slowly this time
How are you feeling
Uh okay I guess he says
He forces his hand to unclench from Tucker’s arm
I know my name and that I’m on Chorus and that I just had surgery
Are all your memories still there
Tucker blurts
He winces when Dr Grey slants him a furious look that Wash probably wasn’t meant to see
Sorry
I just
It’s fine Wash says because the last thing he wants the absolute last thing is for Tucker or anyone else to start walking on eggshells around him
Ilost a few things I think but I don’t know what
That will come in time Dr Grey says calmly
She clicks the scanner off and comes to stand in front of him
Wash the fact that you are this lucid and were able to fight the nanobots for as long as you didI hope you know what that says about your mental strength
He’s shaking his head before she finishes her words
It wasn’t me he says
I would’veif it weren’t for you he meets her eyes
Emily thank you
She turns away with a little huff but not before Wash sees the way her eyes are glistening
Well you’re welcome silly
I will admit it wasn’t all my genius
We had quite the team in there
Tucker did a remarkable job not falling into his usual hysterics
Hey
And the doctor well and Sarge he provided some much needed assistance
Epsilon did his part as well
Where’s that pesky AI anyway
Epsilon logs on so suddenly that it leaves Wash reeling slightly
Right here
What do we need
His head jerks back in surprise when Dr Grey turns back to them and holds her palm out
After a moment Epsilon steps into it
Thank you she says formally
The theatrics were rather unnecessary but it was quite helpful to have a set of eyes on the inside
Uh Epsilon says sounding vaguely stunned for only a moment
Uh
Sure
I mean
It was pretty easy stuff
His voice slips back into its normal nonchalance
Wash can feel it though before he masks it his unfiltered shock at being deemed useful in such a context
Wash clears his throat before he can lose his nerve
Thank you he says stiffly and Epsilon whips around to look at him
Thank you forhelping
To save it
My life
Epsilon isn’t as quick to mask his shock this time and his Yeah sure is far more stunted than it was to Dr Grey
I mean I did kind of
Owe you you should really thank Tucker
And Caboose
I uh
Don’t think if I could’ve done it if it weren’t for them making fucking puppy dog eyes at me
And Grey yelling her head off
So
Wash looks at Tucker who is for some reason looking at him apprehensively
Thanks
Oh
Uh
Yeah Tucker gives himself a shake
Okay so if we’re all done thanking each other awkwardly now I certainly hope so Dr Grey sniffs then tilts her head at Wash
When she feels his gaze on her
Yes
Tronosky
Dr Grey and Epsilon freeze at the same moment so in sync that it’s nearly comical
Youremember that Dr Grey says recovering her composure
Wash nods
How did he get here
Dr Grey regards him carefully
Would you like to see him
Yes
Tucker and Epsilon make joint noises of despair and Dr Grey whirls on them
Oh for heaven’s sake you two
He did just help me save Wash’s life you know
Still Tucker grunts while Epsilon shakes his head vigorously
Yeah uhthat's pretty much the last person I wanna fucking see right now
Or you know ever
I’m gonna need to not be here for that happy reunion
Is Carolina around
He says it so casually that Wash doesn’t almost catch the implication
Oh he says quickly once Epsilon’s words register
Yeah
Right
You should go
There’s no reason for him to still be in my head right
None at all Dr Grey says lightly
Shall I call in Agent Carolina
Epsilon doesn’t say a word doesn’t allow a single errant thought to drift across Wash’s mind
Letting Wash make the decision that is no decision at all
Yes he says
Page her please
Tronosky too
Dr Grey rolls her eyes a little
I don’t need to page her silly
She’s right outside the door
So is Alexander
I’ll be right back
She exits quickly leaving Tucker fidgeting one hand cupped over the back of his neck
So should I like give you two a moment or No Wash and Epsilon say in unison and the three of them sit there in awkward silence until Carolina is pushing her way through the infirmary doors a moment later
She does not falter but walks to the other side of Wash’s bed and takes off her helmet resting it on his mattress
You called
He just nods a little
You came
He knows that she catches the underlying meaning in his words particularly when Tucker rolls his eyes and mutters
Sooo dramatic
So Wash gestures towards Epsilon
I thought it was time thatyou know
Carolina regards him carefully for a moment before nodding gaze shifting to the AI
Epsilon
Right
Yeah
Epsilon turns back to Wash raising his hand awkwardly
Well
Bye I guess
Bye Wash says automatically
Epsilon pulls from his mind slowly carefully; he untangles himself bit by bit until there is only a whisper left
He hesitates for a moment nothing more than a single tendril wrapped around Wash’s thoughts before he’s gone leaving Wash’s mind light and open and his
It’s so deliberately gentle the way he leaves nothing at all like the breathtaking pain of having Epsilon ripped from his implants all those years ago although this time leaves his chest aching slightly with things left unsaid
Perhaps he thinks for the first time perhaps it’s better that way after all
The door opens at that exact moment and they all turn to see Dr Tronosky hesitating in the doorway
Epsilon vanishes at once and Carolina sighs looking at Wash
I should go
I’ll come back later
Yeah he says
Thanks boss
Carolina slips out behind Dr Tronosky who is still in the doorway
Well don’t just stand there Alexander Dr Grey says with a tut
Come here and look at these scans and then I’ll leave you two be
Tucker pushes himself to a stand not even trying to hide the fact that he’s placing himself between Wash and Dr Tronosky
He glares at Tronosky the entire time Dr Grey flips through the results on her medical scanner one hand shoved into the pocket of his fatigues where Wash can clearly see the outline of his sword
Tucker he mutters tugging at Tucker’s arm but Tucker is as still as a statue the tension clear in every line of his body
All in all Dr Grey says brightly switching off the scanner he’s doing quite well physically
I’ll leave you two alone for a moment and then I really must insist that Wash rest
She flounces over to the door pausing to look back only when she notices that Tucker isn’t following her
Yeahhh Tucker says slowly
Yeah I gotta say it’s pretty fucking hilarious that you think I’m leaving Wash alone in here with Dr Frankenstein
Wash winces as Dr Grey swells arms folding across her chest as she eyes Tucker dangerously
Lavernius Tucker
It’s fine Emily Dr Tronosky says sounding as if he’s biting back a laugh
I don’t mind if Tucker stays
That is of course if Wash doesn’t
Wash sighs looking side-long at Tucker
Tucker Tucker’s stance is tense and angry the hand not gripping his sword resting protectively on Wash’s shoulder
His eyes are laser focused on Dr Tronosky but they flick to Wash the moment he says his name and Wash’s words
It’s fine you can go – die on his tongue
For the briefest of moments Tucker’s anger and bravado fall away and Wash can see a bone-deep terror
The look in Tucker’s eyes nearly knocks the wind from him and Wash thinks he sees some of what Tucker went through over the past three weeks
He tries to think of how he’d feel if one of his own had been taken and hurt far beyond his reach and knows that he wouldn’t want them out of his sight for a second
Okay he says instead
You can stay
Tucker’s face crumples in relief for only a second before he snaps his gaze back to Dr Tronosky
His hand falls from Wash’s shoulder and he steps back a few feet hand still on his sword but giving them a bit of space
Over his shoulder Dr Grey rolls her eyes and exits the infirmary with a muttered Honestly
The door shuts and Wash locks eyes with Dr Tronosky
Hi
Hi Dr Tronosky says
For a moment they simply look at each other eyes roving over each other’s faces
Dr Tronosky’s dark black hair is speckled with grey now and there is a new scar down his right temple but the glasses are the same and he even has the exact same lab coat he wore in recovery
Thank you Wash blurts at the same time that Dr Tronosky says I’m sorry
The both jerk back slightly blinking
Dr Tronosky recovers first
You don’t need to thank me Wash
Of course I do Wash says surprised
You saved my life
I destroyed your life
There is no waver in Dr Tronosky’s voice no break in his gaze only a slight slump of his shoulders to indicate how heavy his words weight
You should have never been in a position for someone to hurt you using your implants
That’s on me and Ican’t tell you how sorry I am
Uh could we maybe save the soul-searching conversations until Wash has been out of brain surgery for more than five seconds
Tucker snaps
I mean for fuck’s sake
It’s fine Wash says patting his arm somewhat automatically before turning back to Dr Tronosky
I don’tblame you for what happened
You should
Jesus Tucker grumps how long have you been practicing this speech anyway
For quite some time Dr Tronosky says as if it’s a serious question and Tucker rolls his eyes but I never thought I’d have the opportunity to say these words
I
 don’t know if you know Wash but they leveled the hospital that you were in during Recovery
Wash nods
I thought you were dead too
I thought
Wait wait DON’T--
Wash screams
The Counselor pulls the trigger and the man falls and Wash screams howls fights against his restraints with everything he has
He screams as they drag the bodies out as they haphazardly wipe up the blood and the brains and the pieces of skull
He screams until he is alone in the room alone with his thoughts alone alone alone
Tucker and Dr Tronosky both glance at his monitors in alarm and Wash follows their gaze to see that his heart rate is spiking
He puts a hand on his chest forces himself to breathe and refocuses on Dr Tronosky
Samira and Jackson
Do you remember them
Of course Dr Tronosky says bewildered
But why
Are they okay
Have you been in contact with them
Are they okay
Wash Tucker says in alarm
He puts a hand on Wash’s shoulder and presses him back against the pillows
Wash hadn’t even realized he’d been leaning forward and brushes Wash’s hair out of his eyes again
C’mon you need to calm down
Right Wash mutters
He breathes deep trying to force his expression into something politely neutral and robustly sane
He looks back at Dr Tronosky who is staring at Tucker’s hand in Wash’s hair with the strangest look on his face
Just
Are you in touch
Dr Tronosky jolts a little
No
Unfortunately I’m not
I might be able to send a few messages out though if it’s important to you
He regards Wash carefully
Any particular reason you ask
Wash hesitates for far too long and in the end he cannot answer just shakes his head mutely
Okay Tucker says nervously
Okay I really think you should just try to take a nap or something
I agree
Dr Tronosky hesitates then reaches a hand out to Wash
I amvery glad to see you alive and surrounded by people whowell
By people
Me too Wash says and as he clasps Dr Tronosky’s hand to shake it Tucker groans
Oh my God would you stop it with the drama
You two are like kindred fucking spirits Wash wakes up the next morning to something feather light landing on his legs and the sound of an armored body throwing itself into the chair by his bed
He opens his eyes as the chair creeks ominously and blinks over at Grif who is removing his helmet and tossing his hair out of his eyes
You’re welcome he says by way of greeting
Wash frowns waiting for an explanation but Grif merely rips the wrapper off of a chocolate bar and stuffs half the thing in his mouth
When Wash continues to stare Grif rolls his eyes propping his boots up on Wash’s bed and gesturing towards Wash’s legs which are covered with
Chocolate bars
Not just two or three but at least twenty chocolate bars
While Wash gapes Grif thrusts a pudding cup into his hand
Eat that and don’t be fucking weird about it alright
I figure you probably haven’t had sugar in like a month and that’s just a crime so I’m sharing my stash with you
Is this Wash takes the pudding cup from Grif’s hands
Is this real chocolate
Of course it’s real chocolate dumbass
Where did you get it
Supply run
Wash throws up his hand and Grif squeaks as he almost sends the pudding cup flying
Is there anything you guys don’t get on supply runs
Grif makes a noise that Wash figures is supposed to be a ‘no’ but seeing as how his mouth is full of chocolate it’s hard to tell
Wash dips his spoon into the chocolate and sigh when the sweetness hits his tongue
Thanks Grif
I said not to be weird Grif snaps
I was saying thank you
Yeah weirdly
Like
Dramatically
But
Shhhhhhh
Chocolate
Food
Eat
They lapse into a comfortable silence and Wash notices for the first time that Tucker is sprawled out on an adjacent bed fast asleep
He spent the night
Grif gives him a look
Dude are you kidding
He hasn’t slept in his own bed since you’ve been gone
Wash freezes spoon halfway to his mouth
He hasn’t
Uh Grif lowers the chocolate bar
Whoops
Probably shouldn’t have said that
Then where has he been sleeping
Grif shrugs
Where hasn’t he been sleeping
The hospitalmy floorDonut’s floormostly Donut’s floor really
But why
Wash Grif says his voice pained I did not come here to discuss your pining lover
I came here to eat chocolate and get away from Simmons’ constant fawning over the Architect
And Sarge’s constant fawning over the Architect
And the Architect himself
And everyone
Now please
Stop asking uncomfortable questions and eat chocolate with me
Grif stares him down until Wash dutifully takes another bite of pudding and the comfortable silence resumes
A rush of affection for Grif sweeps over him but he says nothing just enjoys the sounds of Tucker’s rhythmic breathing in the background and the crinkling of the candy bar wrappers
Wash has just started on his second chocolate bar when the door swings open and Caboose bounds into the room Simmons trailing behind him
Grif groans a little but the sound is cut off when Tucker wakes with a gasp
He rolls to his feet snagging his sword off the bedside table and igniting it all in one fluid motion
His movements are so quick and sure that Wash would be positively bursting with pride if it weren’t for the wild terrified look on his face as he scans the room eyes locking onto their faces one by one
There’s a moment of tense silence before he powers off his sword dropping it hastily back onto the table and forcing a smile onto his face
Jesus Caboose could you be any louder
The noise and movement in the room resumes but Wash tracks Tucker’s movements as Caboose wanders over to his bed
Tucker is turned away from him running a trembling hand through his dreads but when he catches Wash staring he offers a shaky smile
Wash frowns a little but is immediately distracted as Grif makes a noise of despair
Chocolate
Caboose cries in delight making in a beeline for one of the candy bars
Nu-uh
Grif drapes himself across Wash’s legs covering the candy bars protectively
No way these are mine
Mine and Wash’s
I already gave you one Caboose
But I aaate that one already
What else were you gonna do with it
Wash rolls his eyes wresting a chocolate bar from where it’s trapped under Grif’s elbow
Grif it’s fine he can have one of mine He frees the candy bar and hands it to Caboose who beams at him as if Wash just single-handedly won the war
Oh-oh Wash that is so nice of you to give me one of your chocolate bars
One of my chocolate bars Grif sulks but he flops back in his chair
Moments later he’s sitting back up straight as Sarge and Donut enter the room as well
Oh my God get out
All of you
Agent Freckles
Sarge booms
He snags a chair on his way over and drags it across the room parking it by Wash’s bedside
Finally you’re awake
I’ve been rehearsing the story of your daring rescue and I think I’ve finally got it in tip top shape
Jesus Christ Grif says to the ceiling
Can it Grif Sarge snaps
Not as if you would know anyway seeing as you were flying the plane
Okay why does everyone keep saying that
If I hadn’t flown the plane none of you would have ever gotten out of there
Hogwash Sarge says airily
We’d have found a way
No you would not have
Anyway Sarge clears his throat sitting up importantly in his chair as Caboose takes a seat on Wash’s bed watching Sarge politely
Our story begins with the one and only Doctor Emily Grey the fair lady I am lucky enough to call my lover
Oh God Tucker mutters throwing himself back down onto his hospital bed and throwing an arm over his eyes
Please someone put me out of my misery
Now you may not know this Frecklancer but the good doctor is the one who came up with that plane to rescue you
Wash blinks
She did
Sure did
Sarge says proudly
It was a plan of pure ingenuity conceived in our utmost time of need
Subway system Grif says flatly
We used the subway system
Grif
Sarge howls
Get out
You’re ruining m’story
Things degenerate quickly after that
Grif and Simmons’ eventual argument over whether or not it’s truly a secret mission if someone back on base knows about it brings Dr Grey storming into the room
She kicks them out and they leave sulkily one by one Grif leaving a generous five candy bars behind
When Tucker lingers behind Wash nudges at his arm
Go on
It’s lunchtime
I’m not hungry Tucker says quickly
It’s cool I’ll just eat in here
Wash sighs
Tucker
What
Tucker mumbles
Tucker you know I’m okay right
Are you
The light-hearted atmosphere from earlier vanishes at once and although Dr Grey doesn’t look up she pauses ever so briefly in her note-taking
Yes
I am
Tucker picks at a stray thread in Wash’s hospital sheets
Okay ‘cause I know those things are out of your head but you still went through a lot of fucked up shit that I know you’re gonna try to pretend didn’t happen
I’m not trying to pretend anything didn’t happen
Wash protests
I
Promise
I Wash looks at him
Yes
I promise
I just If they get anything back at all it’ll be a pile of matchsticks when I ask you a question I want you to answer it it must be difficult for a soldier of your caliber to be rendered so helpless for so long it appears that I do know you quite well after all a shame really I have such a thing for blonds
I can’t Wash chokes out
The mere thought of the look on Tucker’s face if Wash told him what happened told him any of it has him looking away
I justcan’t yet
Tucker Dr Grey says softly
Why don’t you go get a bite to eat
Wash will still be here when you’re done
Tucker looks at her sharply for a moment before glancing back down at Wash
Yeahokay
Okay I’ll do that
He leans in as if he’s going to kiss Wash but pulls himself up short grabbing Wash’s hand and pressing it to his mouth instead
I’ll be back
Okay
I know Wash says
I know you will
Go get some food I’m fine
Tucker hesitates for a moment more before leaving pulling the door shut quietly behind him
Wash waits until Tucker’s footsteps disappear before he lets out a shaky breath
He squeezes his eyes shut hands fisting in his hair as he leans forward elbow to knees and breathes
Nearly a minute passes where he breathes and shakes breathes and shakes before Dr Grey places a hand on his shoulder
Wash
I’m okay he gasps
I’m okay I swear  I just His face feels hot and he can’t look at her just keeps breathing into his hands while she simply stands there her palm a solid warm weight on his back
That’s right she says softly
Just keep breathing Wash
Can you count for me
Don’t want to he wheezes
Don’twant I know
He doesn’t
He doesn’t want to count because he’s fine fine fine just like he told Tucker
If he counts he will be wrong he will be admitting that’s he’s not fine not not not One
Good
Dr Grey squeezes his shoulder a quick reassuring pressure
Keep going
Two
He gives her two
He gives her two and three and all the way up until ten until he is breathing steady into his palms once more
When he glances up squinting against the lights that suddenly seem so bright it is to see Dr Grey sitting on the edge of his bed waiting patiently as if she could sit there forever until he was ready
Do you want to talk about this
This
It is such a wild understatement that it’s somehow perfect and yet Wash doesn’t know what to say
He doesn’t know how to begin or if he should or if it even matters
His stomach swoops sickeningly at the thought of having to tell her tell Tucker tell anyone about the breathing tube down his throat about Felix’s teeth on his neck about the brains of the nurses they killed splattered on his floor
It’s too much
It’s too big the enormity of it of having someone in his mind manipulating playing as if his brain didn’t even belong to him
He doesn’t know what to say
He doesn’t know what to say and still Dr Grey sits there waiting for Wash’s answer patient and unassuming as if she could wait forever if he needed her to
Wash thinks she just might
I woke up in the snow
The words rip from him painful and sharp on the way out as if each one is made from glass and Wash says it again revels in the way they tear at his throat
I woke up in the snow
They made me think that they left me there and I was
I was that’s how I woke up
In the snow
Dr Grey doesn’t comment on the absurdity of the statement does not tell him that it wasn’t snowing when he was taken and that he doesn’t know what he’s talking about
Were you cold she asks instead
He was
He was cold because it had felt so real all of it and it is still there in his head
The thought of talking about it is unthinkable
The thought of keeping it inside of himself is unbearable
Wash looks at Dr Grey
Looks at her bouncy curls and bright brown eyes at two of the only hands on Earth he would trust inside his brain
Looks at his friend
At his doctor
Wash it sounds to me as if you were psychologically abused
I was so cold
He looks at her and he tells her his story
There was a time not so very long ago when Tucker was only able to sleep under very specific conditions
Naked
In a bed
Flat on his back
One arm tucked under a pillow
The room as dark as he could possibly get it
The simple nature of being in the military had forced him to learn how to sleep during other circumstances (wearing full armor with a gun clutched to his chest in the blazing desert heat) but he had never liked it
He was never good at it was always cranky and light-headed the next day
No matter how long the less-than-ideal situation dragged on he never felt properly rested until he’d gotten a good night’s sleep in whatever the fuck passed for his own bed these days
He'd always been able to adjust easily to sharing a bed with whomever he was dating or sleeping with and Wash was no different was in fact one of the best sleeping partners Tucker has ever had
Wash didn’t mind if Tucker draped all over his chest or if Tucker’s hair fell across his face or if Tucker snored a little; Wash loved all these things the weight the texture the noise
It had been the most natural thing in the world to adjust to sharing a bed and although the learning curve was steeper for Wash and they’d had plenty of bad nights Wash had been relaxing into their routine a little more each night
And so Tucker’s very specific conditions had shifted to sleeping on his stomach sprawled out across Wash’s chest
From rooms as dark as he could get them to the blinds cracked in to let in some starlight
From sleeping with only a thin sheet to curling up in an all-encompassing warmth that Tucker couldn’t bear to pull away from no matter how cold he liked to sleep
How quickly things changed
Over the course of the last month Tucker had become an expert at sleeping in any and all conditions
On the floor of Donut’s room
In full armor in the landing bay
In the mess hall
Propped up in a visitor’s chair with his head on Wash’s hospital bed
His sleep wasn’t restful but his body took what it could get stealing a few hours here and there
The thought of sleeping warm and comfortable in his bed while Wash was more than likely cold and hurt strapped to a bed with his head cracked open horrible monstrous things forced into his beautiful brain
Unthinkable to be warm while Wash was cold
Impossible to be safe while Wash was in danger
Unbearable
Tucker
Did you hear me
Tucker startles then tries to compose himself under Dr Grey’s suspicious gaze
I’mah fuck me no
I didn’t
Sorry I’m just tired
It’s not a lie but Tucker still berates himself silently for the slip
He had to pull it together or Dr Grey was going to see that he was a walking disaster and make good on her threat to restrict his contact with Wash
Sorry he adds again
What were you saying
I was just saying that Wash can leave today
Leavewhere
The suspicious look is back on Dr Grey’s face
Why leave the infirmary of course
Right Tucker says quickly
Okay but don’t you think it’s a little soon
The words are out before Tucker can think to filter them and Wash glares at him out of the corner of his eye obviously
Because not only did Wash hate hospitals to begin with he had just spent the past month being forced to live in some sort of horror-movie version of one
Now Tucker was suggesting that he should stay in this one for even longer
Christ he sure was making a play for partner of the year
I just meantsorry Tucker mumbles and some of the ice in Wash’s expression melts
I’m okay he reminds Tucker for what must be the thousandth time
Tucker restrains himself from flipping over the nearest cart of medicinal supplies only with supreme effort of will resists to the urge to scream that Wash cannot possibly be fine shoves down the burning desire to throw himself on Wash and vow hysterically that Tucker will never let anyone hurt him ever again
Right he says again instead and glances at Dr Grey
So medically he’s fine
You’ve fixed his implants and shit
For real
We have Dr Grey says simply
She eyes Wash
Now he knows that he is not to even think about putting on a suit of armor or picking up a weapon but he’s cleared for physical therapy and should resume eating at regular intervals
Staying in this hospital bed is no longer necessary nor beneficial
Okay Tucker says slowly
Soso we justgo
You just go Dr Grey says cheerfully
Wash She holds out a hand and Wash pushes himself out of his chair and shakes it then pulls her into a hug
Tucker watches Dr Grey’s eyes go wide with surprise before fluttering closed her arms coming up around Wash to hug him back just as tightly
Tucker steps awkwardly to the side feeling like an intruder a feeling that in no way lessens when Wash pulls away and says Thank you
Oh go on Dr Grey says her eyes a little brighter than normal
Ten o’clock in the morning tomorrow my office
Got it
Got it Wash says and he turns to Tucker
Ready
Tucker pushes open the door
We should uh
Go to you room
Get your shit settled
Wash nods and they begin to walk
So Tucker says in the most casual voice he can manage why do you have to go to Grey’s in the morning
If he didn’t know Wash so well Tucker would have missed the slight stiffening in his shoulders
We’re just going to discuss a few things Wash says his voice equally as casual
Oh
Gotcha
That’s cool
Drop it Tucker tells himself sternly
If he wanted to tell you he fucking would
After nearly a minute of internal debate in which Tucker finds himself utterly incapable of dropping it he eyes Wash
So you’re talking to her then
Hmm
To Grey
You’re talking to her aboutabout what happened
The tension grows in Wash’s body but his voice is still light and inconsequential
Yeah
Yeah I am
Oh is all Tucker can manage before clearing his throat
That’s uh
That’s good
That’s great
Yeah Wash says and they resume their silence Tucker waring fiercely with the sudden jealousy that’s sprung up in him
Of course he’s fucking talking to her he snaps at himself
She’s his doctor
She fixed his head and saved all of your asses while you were whining like a bitch
If he wants to talk to you he will
It wouldn’t be so bad if the tension in the air wasn’t so thick that Tucker could practically see it; if Wash didn’t look as if he were two steps away from bolting
The silence between them is tense in a way that Tucker had almost forgotten entirely tense in a way that makes him think of Sidewinder and yellow spray paint and the two of them glaring in opposite directions while a coffee pot gurgled between them
There’s so much more than a coffee pot between them now and the anxious knot in Tucker’s stomach tightens
Stop looking at me like that
It’s a few more steps before Tucker realizes that Wash has stopped walking and is glaring at him with his arms folded tightly across his chest
Tucker stops as well staring at him
Looking at you like what
Wash clenches his jaw eyes darting away
Likelike I’m a bomb about to go off
I’m not
Tucker exclaims
Wash I’m not
Okay
Good
Because I’m fine
Tucker closes his eyes for a brief moment and counts to five
Okay Wash
Whatever you say
I don’t need you to Wash waves a hand between them in a space that feels miles wide
I don’t need you to do this
Do what
This
Follow me
Watch me
Wash Tucker says with all the calm he can muster
I’m just walking you to your room
That’s it
That’s all I’m doing
Wash stares at him suspiciously for a moment before nodding tersely and continuing the way forward
It takes nearly fifteen minutes for them to reach the doorway to Wash’s room when it should only take five
First they run into a group of Feds each of whom seems to regard it as a personal duty to wring Wash’s hand
Two minutes after that three cadets run up to them
Tucker can tell that they are restraining themselves from sobbing all over Wash with supreme difficultly but to their credit they don’t
They’re almost at Wash’s room when Caboose melts out of the doorway of his own room with a joyful cry of Wash
Wash who fucking always has a smile for Caboose doesn’t disappoint now even if it doesn’t quite reach his eyes
Hi Caboose
Caboose bounds forward and is literally in the process of lifting his arms to wrap Wash in a hug when he freezes body going rigid and still like a statue
It would be comical if it weren’t for the way his face falls in sudden devastation and after a moment his arms fall limply to the side
Agent Washington Caboose says in this weird formal tone as he snaps into a salute nearly smacks off the wall in his haste to change directions and then takes off down the hallway at full speed
Tucker winces a little at the crestfallen expression on Wash’s face
Oh no Wash sighs biting his lip
He turns to Tucker
Do youdo you think he’s still upset
About What about almost killing you
Tucker raises his eyebrows
Yeah Wash
I think he’s still upset
The words leave Tucker’s mouth before he can even think to censor them but even as he silently berates himself for sounding like the world’s biggest asshole Wash just sighs and pushes open the door to his room
I should talk to him he says absently
Make sure he knows everything’s okay
Everything’s okay I’m fine don’t worry about me
Tucker is fairly certain if he hears one more variation of that phrase from Wash he’s going to scream
He manages to hold it in this time and the two of them stand there in the doorway of Wash’s room gazing inward
The room is untouched a fine layer of dust on the wooden crate and metal locker bedsheets perfectly tucked in at the corners
Tucker’s eyes lock onto Wash’s bed tugged around so that it’s facing the window and he remembers how he’d thought about that bed and berated himself for never asking Wash about it
Why did you do that he blurts now overwhelmed with a desire to know now
Move your bed I mean
Why’d you drag it to face the window
To his surprise the corners of Wash’s mouth curve up into a small smile
Oh that’s how I slept on the ship
In Freelancer
It started becausewell
Maine we were roommates I can’t remember if I ever told you that
There’s the slightest underlying note of alarm in Wash’s voice and Tucker rushes to reassure him
No no you never told me
Right Wash says
He makes his way into his room and sits on the edge of the bed looking out the window
Maine hated sleeping in the dark so we always kept the blinds open
WellI got tired of craning my neck around to look out the window so I turned my bed
You get some pretty cool views of the galaxy when you live on a spaceship
Totally Tucker says with a grin
So it’s just a habit
Wash pauses for a second too long and when he meets Tucker’s eyes again it’s with a somewhat defiant tilt to his chin
Alpha hated the dark too
He did
Tucker remembers how grateful he was that they never shared a room back at Blue Base because Church would constantly sleep with the fucking lights on
It takes Tucker a moment to understand what that has to do with Wash before he remembers that of course it does because Wash probably knows Alpha’s sleeping habits better than anyone
Oh is all Tucker can manage
It helps meremember
Wash gestures at the window
When I wake up and there’s some light some natural light it’s something to focus on
Tucker wonders despite trying his very hardest not to if Felix and Locus had kept him in the dark
We can switch the bed in my room too he blurts instead
It’s a moment before Wash will meet his eyes
Tuckeryou don’t have to do that
I want to Tucker says earnestly
Fuck I don’t give a shit which way my bed faces if you like to look outside then that’s cool
That’s not what I meant
Dread pools in the pit of Tucker’s stomach once more gathers heavy in his throat but he speaks around it anyway
What did you mean
I meant Wash sighs
Tucker you don’t have to take care of me
The dread vanishes at once replaced by a hurt so deep Tucker feels it in his bones
It kicks the wind right out of him and when he speaks his words come a little breathless
Wash I know that
I know I don’t have to
Okay Wash says
Because I’m
Fine Tucker grits out
Yeah
You’re fine
I know
An uncomfortable silence settles between them the ease of their brief conversation about the window gone
You should go
Ido you want me to go
I have a lot to do today Wash says eventually
Like what
Tucker challenges
What the fuck could you possibly have to do
Well Wash says calmly I have to go to the armory to get fitted for new armor
Dr Grey said you shouldn’t be wearing armor Tucker accuses at once
She said you shouldn’t even fucking think about it
She meant that I shouldn’t use it not that I can’t be fitted for it Wash snaps
I’m going to need it eventually
Which is something that Tucker can’t even bring himself to think about just yet
Wash out there fighting again in armor
I have to meet with Kimball and Doyle as well
They want to know if I heard or saw anything that might be helpful in in that hospital
Tucker knows he’s pushing his luck but this is too much
Are you fucking kidding me he asks aghast
They want you to talk to them about what happened don’t you think it’s a little early for that
It’s fine Wash insists
I’m fine
I can talk to them about
Is there anyone on this base that you aren’t planning to talk to besides me
Wash jerks back a little frown lines appearing between his eyebrows
I what
Nothing Tucker mutters
Look I
I have stuff to do today too alright
I’ll
I’ll see you later
He takes his time dragging his feet out of the door hoping that Wash will tell him not to go but Wash doesn’t say a word
Wash makes absolutely no move to stop him and before Tucker knows it he’s standing at the end of the hallway glaring back at Wash’s door with his hands shoved in his pockets
Okay
This is fine
He just just has to get over himself is all
Wash wants space Tucker can give him space
There’s plenty of other shit he can be doing like
His knuckles brush against something hard in his pocket and Tucker pulls the object out with a frown
Dog tags
Fitz’s dog tags
With a rush of guilt he realizes all at once where he needs to be
Tucker spends a good five minutes fidgeting outside the doorway to the larger section of the infirmary working up the nerve to walk in
He hasn’t been in here since before their rescue mission partially because things had been so touch and go with Wash
That and because he can’t bear to think about what’s waiting for him on the other side of the door
Tucker pushes it open anyway taking a deep breath and fishing Fitz’s dog tags out of the pocket of his fatigues once more
He feels equal parts relief and trepidation as every eye in the infirmary zooms towards him and takes a few more determined steps into the room
Captain Tucker Andersmith’s voice breathes from the nearest bed
It’s an honor to see you
There’s a scoff from across the way and Tucker glances up to see Sabine standing at Ali’s bedside arms folded tightly across her chest
That’s one word for it
Tucker swallows hard looking back to Andersmith
How uh
How are you feeling
Right as rain Andersmith says staunchly following Tucker’s gaze to the bandages across most of his chest
A simple wound
Mostly healed
How is Agent Washington
He’s out of the hospital Tucker says then deciding he can’t ignore the silence that has swept the entire infirmary he addresses them all
Wash
Agent Washington won’t be back in the field for a while but uh
He’s out of the hospital soso yeah
His chest tightens at the murmur of relief that goes through the room
Is it true one of the Feds
Flint Tucker remembers after a moment asks from where’s he’s propped up in bed
Is it true that the Architect came back to help operate on Wash’s brain
Tucker gnashes his teeth together weighs the pros and cons of lying and ultimately can’t find any convincing reason not to tell the truth
Christ he’s never met a bigger bunch of gossips in his life
Yeah
Yeah it’s true
Cool Flint says to general enthusiasm
So he’ll be fine then
Tucker rolls his eyes
Yeah
He’ll be alright
Uh He fidgets caught between a wild desire to make a motivational speech and to sprint right back out the fucking doorway
In the end the words won’t come but he forces himself look around at them all anyway
Uh
Thanks
I
I wish that mission hadn’t been so fucked and I’mI’m sorry
He turns to the nearest bed where Flint is gesturing for his attention
Tucker makes his way through the room exchanging a few words with those who wish it and simply nodding at the ones who don’t
He avoid Ali’s bed for as long as possible and when he can do so no longer he crosses the room with his eyes locked onto Sabine’s
She tracks his progress the whole way and when he reaches the bedside she says You’re not welcome here not troubling to keep her voice down
Ali is too polite to say it so I will
Leave
I just Tucker forces himself to look at Ali then looks at where his arm cuts off at the wrist before meeting those calm dark eyes
He holds out Fitz’s dog tags
I just wanted to give these back to you and saysay I’m sorry
I shouldn’t have dragged you onto that mission
You didn’t drag me anywhere Ali says
He rolls his eyes and takes the dog tags clutching them tightly
That mission was volunteer only
We all knew what we were getting into
You had no idea what you were getting yourselves into Sabine continues undaunted
If Captain Tucker hadn’t been so reckless we would’ve had more time
But he was so eager to rescue his boyfriend
Wash is my friend too Sabine
Sabine snorts
Do you think he considers you one
You think he would’ve gone on that mission for you
Agent Washington would leave this planet in a heartbeat if it was in his best interests
Agent Washington just spent the better part of a month being tortured because he was taken on a mission while protecting this planet Tucker says through gritted teeth
Don’t if you want to blame someone blame me
Oh don’t worry I am
Ali sighs rolling his head to look at Tucker
How is he
Really
He’s okay Tucker says automatically
Great
Now he’s fucking doing it saying Wash is fine when he’s not
I mean he will be
He’sthey really did a number on him
Man this is so fucked up
I’m sorry I cut your hand off Tucker blurts
He thinks if they dance around the subject for another second he might scream
I’m
I’m so sorry
Tucker Ali sighs again
If you hadn’t I’d be dead
I do know that man
But your art I know that too Ali says and his voice is tighter now smile strained
So just don’t
Okay
This isn’t about you
It’s about Wash and it’s about everyone in this room
It’s not about you and your guilt
So just let it go
Tucker swallows heavily
I can’t do that
Sounds like that’s your problem Sabine growls
Ali places his remaining hand on hers and she leans away but continues to watch him unblinkingly
It is your problem Ali says quietly
I can’t help you with what you’re feeling Tucker
To be honest I don’t really care
Wash was my friend before I was yours and it’s for him that I lost my hand lost my

Ali swallows and Tucker wishes the ground would give way beneath him
We all of us left in this room we went for him and our loses were for him
You could have led us better it’s true but we could have followed better
He reaches out for Tucker but he can’t bring himself to grasp his hand
Ali drops it to the bed with a sigh
Too many of us on Chorus follow blindly now follow friends now because there is nothing else left for us
Your guilt is for you and our deaths are for us
Sabine’s jaw ticks
You’re wasting your words on him Ali
Captain Tucker has no concept of what it is to think beyond himself
Tucker wants to say that’s not true that he’s come so very far from who he was that he understands the loses sustained that if he could he would do everything different
But then he thinks of Wash waking up on Grey’s table and the nastier darker parts of himself rise up and he knows he knows he wouldn’t change a thing not if the risk was for Wash never coming home
Some of this feeling must have shown on his face because Ali smiles grimly
Let it go Tucker
He nods reluctantly
And Tucker
Yeah
Don’t ever bring my hand or my art up again
Okay he whispers and turns to leave
He wants to bolt but he allows himself to be stopped by several other beds on the way to the infirmary where everywhere the questions are the same
How is Wash
How is he really
Is he okay
Are you okay
He’s fine Tucker says over and over and over again and he hates it hates himself more and more with each answer because he cannot say the real one
I don’t know
I don’t know
Tucker walks
He paces the halls of the base wandering up and down familiar corridors and some unfamiliar ones too
Fitz’s tags are no longer in his pocket leaving him nothing to hold onto
Tucker hadn’t even realized how much he’d been doing that lately until they were gone so he alternates between clenching his hands in his fists and tying his hair up and letting it down
Tying it up and letting it down
Tying it up and
It is your problem
Bile rises in the back of his throat and Tucker stumbles to the nearest wall breathing deep
The corridor is blessedly empty and he sinks down against the wall dropping his face between his knees and sucking in air until the overwhelming urge to vomit has passed
Even still he sits there staring dully at the opposing wall holding his right hand in his left and wondering what it’d feel like to lose it
Tucker pulls out his datapad swipes through Basebook until he reaches Ali’s page covered top to bottom in his drawings
He looks at every single one of them even scrolls back to see some paintings made with real paint that must be from before the war
Tucker scrolls to the top and lingers on the one of him staring at Wash in the mess hall that goofy grin on his face
Ali had gotten every detail right the dimples on Tucker’s cheeks the scar on the back of his knuckles the exact thickness of his dreads
Most importantly he’d nailed that silly love struck smile
Sounds like you really fucked uuuup
Wash’s voice whispers through his memory light and teasing and Tucker presses his head back hard into the wall eyes squeezed shut
You have no fucking idea dude he mumbles
There was still so much he had to tell Wash how he hadn’t gotten to his Pelican fast enough how he’d spearheaded that god-awful mission and gotten people killed nine dead three critical two lost limbs thirty minutes
He still had to tell Wash how he’d fucked up this time
Tucker glances at his datapad startled to find that it’s already well into the afternoon
Panic hits him hard a solid wall springing up out of nowhere and Tucker clambers to his feet chest constricting
Wash
He he has to find him has to make sure he’s okay
It’s been hours since Tucker’s last seen him and what if
I don’t need you to take care of me Wash reminds him but Tucker grits his teeth and hastens his steps anyway lets them lead him to the armory
He stops in the doorway keeping carefully out of sight relief spilling over him as he catches sight of Wash’s bright blond hair
He’s standing over a selection of armor that he’s laid out over the floor eying them critically one hand cupped over the back of his neck and the other on his hip
Tucker can’t see his face from here but he can see the dejected slump of his shoulders
The urge to go to him is overwhelming but Tucker does not
He backs out of the doorway slowly and turns the corner
Once more Tucker walks
The antsy energy brought on by the infirmary does not leave him no matter how long he paces which is how Tucker finds himself shuffling reluctantly into the training room out of sheer desperation
He can’t sit still and think about how Wash is fine or isn’t fine or what the fuck he is or isn’t telling Kimball and Doyle right now
Moving is good
Moving is healthy and shit
Moving will distract him
Oh my God Tucker grunts I fucking sound like him
Talking to yourself buddy
Tucker turns to see Epsilon hovering in front of him arms folded
Yeah yeah Tucker says grumpily
Where’s Carolina
He spots her even before he finishes asking the question gloved up across the room and beating the living Christ out of a punching bag
At least he isn’t the only one in a shitty mood
Hey he calls across the room
Wanna spar
Carolina doesn’t turn to look at him although everyone else in the training room does
There aren’t many people in there just a handful of Feds and
Tucker is displeased to see the fucking Architect himself running laps around the perimeter
Ugh what the fuck is he doing here
Good question Epsilon mutters tracking Dr Tronosky’s movements
Guess he doesn’t have any other brains to carve up
See you’re not scared of him anymore at least Tucker says and Epsilon glares at him
Hey fuck you I wasn’t scared of him
Epsilon protests
I just you know don’t exactly love the guy is all
That makes two of us
Oh cut it out you two Carolina says appearing a little breathlessly at Tucker’s shoulder
You’re both too worked up about this
Carolina here is bound and determined to prove how much his presence doesn’t bother her Epsilon says sourly
She’s got a point to prove
Carolina rolls her eyes at him before turning to Tucker
Are we sparring or what
Fuck yeah we are
Good
Get your sword
Tucker makes a face enthusiasm wilting
Ugh I don’t wanna spar with my sword
Can’t we do some hand to hand instead
No Carolina says
She glances around a little and lowers her voice
There’s a big mission coming up
Okay is it a super secret mission too
Yes Carolina says seriously either not picking up on Tucker’s sarcasm or choosing to ignore it
Epsilon rolls his whole head in the background
We’re going to try to take that hospital
The smirk disappears from Tucker’s face at once
Wait we are
The one where they had Wash
That’s the one Carolina says
She reaches behind Tucker for the equipment racks dragging their practice swords to the forefront
Dr Grey recognized some of the nurses when we were breaking Wash out
They’re civilians
Sowe’re gonna try to rescue them
That’s right
Carolina smiles but there’s nothing pleasant about it only something twisted and ugly that Tucker revels in
And if we run into Felix and Locus all the better
Tucker grins fiercely back
Sounds like a fucking plan to me
Carolina nods
Kimball isn’t convinced that you should go
What
Is she fucking kidding
Carolina holds up a hand
Just hold on
I’m not convinced you should go either
I’m not convinced that you can stick to the mission
She overrides Tucker’s sputtering
But I knew that you’d want to
It’s going to be a very close-quarters mission which meanswell
It means we need you and your sword
She thrusts a training sword at him and Tucker takes it
So this is what some kind of fucking test
Something like that Carolina says sweetly
Think you’re up for it
Tucker narrows his eyes
I’m always up for it baby
Thirty minutes later after Carolina has send him sprawling to the mats for the twentieth fucking time Tucker is seriously starting to regret that joke
And this sparring session
And ever picking up that fucking sword to begin with
He hauls himself up anyway with gritted teeth ignoring the snickering from the Feds ignoring Dr Tronosky who has for some reason taken an interest in their sparring match and isn’t even bother to be subtle about watching them as he stretches out from his run
It gets harder and harder to ignore him particularly after the little hmmmm he makes when Tucker lunges in and misses Carolina by three yards
Can I help you he snaps finally lowering his sword and spinning to face Dr Tronosky
’Cause it seems like there’s something you wanna say
Dr Tronosky blinks clearly startled out of some sort of daze
Huh
Oh no my apologies
Continue
Tucker narrows his eyes suspiciously but is jolted back to reality when Carolina grabs him laying the blade across his throat
He curses finally managing to wrest her off and ignoring the fact that he definitely would have lost a hand had that sword been real
Their match continues Tucker sinking back into the flow of it and trying to find an opening in Carolina’s guard something anything
You need to torque your hips more
Tucker groans lowering his sword and whipping around to face him
Dude don’t fucking lecture me on what to do with my hips okay I know what to do with
No do it
Tucker spins to look at Carolina
What
She shrugs
He’s right
You’re still driving from the arms
Drive from your hips
But
Do you want to get better at this or not
Tucker narrows his eyes at Dr Tronosky but turns back to Carolina and this time when he lunges he torques his hips
The increase in force behind his swing is obvious and Tucker doesn’t know whether to be pleased or annoyed
Huh Dr Tronosky says mildly and continues in his stretching
Fuck’s sake Tucker grumbles and resumes training
Five minutes later
You need to increase the tilt of your sword by fifteen degrees
Tucker drops his sword with a clatter
Okay seriously
Like this
Carolina asks and she tilts her sword a little mimicking Tucker’s earlier posture
No tilt it the other way like may I
’ She hands him her sword ignoring Tucker’s sighs and he demonstrates
It’s a slight adjustment in the wrist see
You try
Carolina takes her sword back and does to what Tucker’s eyes looks like the exact same shit he was doing before but her eyes light up in understanding and Dr Tronosky nods his approval
Yes
Did you feel the difference in
In my forearm she says nodding then looks at him appraisingly
Have you used this weapon before
A Sangheilli sword
Can’t say that I have he says
But I did fence in college
Fencing keeps the mind and the body sharp
Jesus Christ Tucker snaps to no one in particular
They both ignore him
Hmmm Carolina says and Tucker doesn’t like the look in her eyes one little bit
Do you think you’d be able to show Tucker some footwork
I know fencing isn’t quite the same but
No no I think a lot of the same principles will apply he muses
It’s a one-handed weapon much like fencing of course the weight is different but Carolina hands him her sword again and he hefts it experimentally
He moves with it a few slashes and stabs that Tucker is very much displeased to see look fucking textbook and a hell of a lot cleaner than his own wild swinging
Tronosky comes to a halt bringing the sword down to his side neatly as if he’s in some training competition and not a training room
I could show you a few things he says to Tucker then glances quickly at Carolina
If that’s okay with you
Carolina shrugs
It’s fine
We haven’t been able to find a single person on this planet who knows any swordplay so Uhh
Tucker glances between the two of them
How about is it okay with me
Because it’s not
Carolina sighs
Tucker he can help you
Are you fucking serious
You watched him do one bullshit kata and you think he’s some sort of protégé
I know movement Carolina snaps
Better than you
We haven’t been able to find a single person on this planet who’s worked with a sword and we have one here on a silver platter
I don’t care of it’s a gold and diamond platter
I don’t want him to teach me shit
Dr Tronosky shrugs offering the sword to Carolina
Well if you change your mind
Wait Carolina says sharply then turns to Tucker
Tucker this isn’t up for debate
You’re learning from him
End of story
What you can’t tell me what to do
Actually I can Carolina says coolly
Kimball and Doyle put me in charge of all training regimens until Wash is fit for duty and I’m assigning you private lessons with Dr Tronosky five days out of the week
Five days a week
Five days
You heard me
She levels a glare at him
I suggest you make the most of them
And then she leaves straight up hands her sword back to Tronosky and walks out the fucking door
Tucker glares at the group of Feds who are looking between the two of them with interest waits until they hasten to continue with their own workouts and then turns to Dr Tronosky
I don’t like you
That’s fine Dr Tronosky says mildly
I can tell
So you don’t wanna train me then
Tucker asks quickly
I have no opinion on the matter Dr Tronosky says with a shrug
It’s been a while since I fenced but I may be able to clean up your footwork
Tucker folds his arms across his chest eyeing the doctor and weighing his options
As much as he’d really really like to tell this fucker where to go he thinks he wants to go on the mission more
Do we have to start now
I think starting tomorrow will be fine Dr Tronosky says
You’ve been training for a while and should probably take a break
I don’t need a break Tucker snaps firing back up
I can keep going I’m fine
Dr Tronosky is eyeing him a little more closely now and Tucker doesn’t look the look on his face one bit
Have you been sleeping
Tucker groans
Dude I just told you I’m fine
I’m fine
I have to go he says abruptly spinning towards the door
Same time tomorrow then
Dr Tronosky calls after him
Tucker grunts
Whatever he snaps and shoulders his through the training room doors
Evening finds Tucker standing outside the door to his quarters warring with himself
He wants nothing more than to go find Wash to flop on his chest and fall asleep for the next ten years but he forces himself not to go searching the base
Wash doesn’t need to hear about Tucker’s shitty day doesn’t need any kind of weird pressure put on him when he has so much to work through already
Yet Tucker still stares at the door to his own room and finds himself unable to push his way inside
He hasn’t been in this room since before Wash had been taken and the thought of sleeping in his bed still fills him with dread
Tucker is just raising his hand to open the door anyway just to look when he hears a noise and turns to see Wash coming down the hallway and his heart lifts
Hey how was
He stops alarmed when he gets a good look at Wash’s anguished face
Whoa what the fuck happ
Why didn’t you tell me
Tucker freezes
Tell you what
Tell me thattell me that Wash breaks off hands going automatically to his hair and clutching tightly in that way he does when he’s stressed or panicking
His hair is longer than Tucker’s ever seen it the strands winding between his fingers
Tucker moves forward reaching for his wrists without thinking but Wash jerks back at the first brush of Tucker’s fingers against his hands
Don’t he gasps voice high and strangled and Tucker backs off at once hands up
Okay he says calmly even though his heart is pounding in his throat
Look why don’t you come in here sit the fuck down and tell me what’s up
Wash does not sit the fuck down nor does he remove his hands from his hair but he does follows Tucker into his room and lets Tucker close it behind them
Tucker hastily retreats to the other side of the room lets Wash be the one closest to the exit
For a while they stand there in silence the only sound Wash’s labored breathing
Tucker’s fingers twitch the urge to go to him to hold onto Wash’s wrists and tell him to count to breathe to stop pulling at his hair is overwhelming but he does nothing says nothing as the silence stretches on and on
Wash he says finally
Tell me what
People died
Everything inside of Tucker freezes blood chilling heart icing over goosebumps rising on his flesh
What he manages to say even though he knows exactly what Wash is talking about
People died Wash says again
People died trying to find me
Wash Tucker says and it takes everything he has to keep the waver out of his voice
Wash it wasn’t
Why
Why didn’t you tell me
Anger sweeps through him at the pure betrayal in Wash’s tone because no
No they are not going there no he is not having this no no no
Uh hmm let me think
See if I can come up with a few reasons
Oh I know how about the fact that you just got out of brain surgery and have been out of the infirmary for like thirty seconds
Or the fact that you were tortured for twenty-four days
Or the fact that I knew you were gonna flip the fuck out
Or
How many
Tucker stops blood thudding in his ears
What
How many people died
I’m not doing this Tucker says with a vehement shake of his head
I’m not gonna give you all these fucking details so you can beat yourself up over them
How many people
There’s a desperate half-crazed look in Wash’s eyes when he asks it and Tucker has to turn away to get himself under control
He half expects to hear the door slamming as Wash leaves and when Tucker turns back around to snap at him it dies in his throat
Wash’s arms are crossed tightly over his chest hands cupping his elbows shoulders hunched as he determinedly meets Tucker’s eye
Wash sit
Down
They stare at each for a few moments before Wash finally moves inching over to sit on Tucker’s bed
Tucker sucks in another breath and comes to sit next to him
I want to know what happened Wash says immediately when he sits
While I was gone
I want to know what happened and I want to know who died and I don’t want you to lie to me about it
Fine Tucker says evenly but I have a condition
Wash’s eyes snap to his immediately closing off defensively
And what’s that
I don’t wanna hear you say any shit like ‘you shouldn’t have come for me’ or ‘I didn’t deserve that
’ Got it
Wash narrows his eyes Tucker
Promise me
Wash opens and closes his mouth several times and Tucker sees it then that Wash can’t
He can’t promise that because it is still so impossibly difficult for him to grasp
Tucker is the one pushing off the bed now ripping the hair tie from his dreads and twisting it angrily as he paces
This is such bullshit
Alright look
No you look
Tucker forces himself to stop pacing but he continues to twist the band over and over until it’s nearly at the point of snapping
I’m so fucking sick and tired of you pulling this bullshit
You don’t know what it was like
You don’t know what it was like
I was we were fucking losing it
Okay
People were losing it with you gone
Don’t you don’t you dare tell me that you weren’t worth it
Don’t you dare tell me that I got people killed for nothing
The band snaps
Wash stops trying to cut in eyes widening as Tucker covers his face with his hands and breathes once twice three times
You don’t know what it was like Tucker says calmly
You have no idea
Then tell me
Tucker casts him a suspicious glare but he inches his way across the room until he’s standing in front of Wash
Nine
That’s how many people died
Nine
We we got that video he spits the word  and people just flipped
I lost it
The intel was shit and I knew it but I was so fucking terrified that we were gonna lose you if we waited another second that I
I pushed for it anyway
The only reason we got in a second time is because Grey had the idea of using the subways and well Sarge told you that part
Wash nods swallowing hard
I
I heard there was a bombing
Jesus Christ
He sure is gonna have a thing or two to say to whoever has been telling Wash this shit so soon
Just after they grabbed you
And don’t you dare say that was your fault too Wash I swear to God
I wasn’t going to
Good
Tucker sets his jaw
Because it really sucked
We lostwe lost a lot of people
Thirty-three
They bombed the fuck out of us and it was the shittiest thing ever because people died and you weren’t there
Wash is quiet for some time before he turns to face Tucker more fully
What else happened
Tucker lets out a hollow laugh dropping his hands and letting them fall heavy in his lap
What do you mean what else
You were gone and we were freaking out
It was horrible
Every single minute was horrible
Wash gestures around the room
You haven’t slept in here
Tucker groans shoving himself off the bed
No Wash I haven’t slept in here
My fucking bed smells like your stupid shampoo and your stupid hair is all over my sheets and I couldn’t like be here in a bed while you were while they were
Wash catches Tucker’s arm as he stalks by
I’m right here Tucker
Tucker exhales a shaky breath turning to squeeze Wash’s hand
He drops to a crouch in front of him presses the back of Wash’s fingers to his mouth and breathes
You saw that video Wash says quietly and Tucker nods
The whole thing
The whole fucking thing Tucker confirms
He waits to see if Wash will say anything more will tell him about the bruises on his face about the knife wound across his cheek about the fucking hickey on his neck but he doesn’t and after a while Tucker sighs
For lack of anything better to do Tucker yanks his shirt over his head and reaches to grabs sweats from his drawer sitting down heavily on the bed
He’s yanking furiously on laces of his boots when Wash’s hands settle over his own
Let me he says quietly
Tucker leans back and lets him
Wash takes his time about it pulling the mess of knots apart methodically loosening the laces all the way down to his feet
He pulls off the right and pauses in the midst of removing the left pressing his forehead to Tucker’s knee
Tucker hesitates before setting his hand gently on Wash’s head hesitates further still before sliding his hand down the back of Wash’s neck to gently cup his implants
When Wash sags further against his knees Tucker doesn’t hide his sigh of relief and starts to run his fingers through Wash’s hair
They’re quiet like that for a time until Wash finally pulls away and finishes pulling off the boot
His head is still bowed and Tucker marvels at what it means that Wash is before him on his knees shoulders slouched and neck exposed
It’s because of that and that alone that Tucker is able to hold himself together when Wash pulls away and rises to his feet
You’re exhausted Tucker
Tucker swallows
I’m
He almost says it
He almost looks Wash in the eye and tells him that he’s fine when he’s not and he chokes the words off just in time
Yeah he says instead
Yeah I’m
I’m pretty fucking tired
He can tell from the slight tightening around Wash’s eyes that he knows damn well what Tucker almost let slip but he says nothing to acknowledge it
Instead he walks over to Tucker’s locker to pull a fresh pillowcase from Tucker’s pilfered stack of sheets and swaps it out for the one that’s been on Tucker’s bed for a month
There he says trying for a smile but not entirely managing it
That one doesn’t have my hair all over it
Before Tucker can answer Wash grabs one of Tucker’s headbands from his bedside crate and slips it carefully over his head
Tucker closes his eyes as Wash carefully tucks his dreads back sliding the headband up over his forehead
He keeps them closed as he feels Wash’s lips press against the top of his head as he feels Wash’s hands cup his cheeks as he feels Wash’s forehead rest against his own
Tucker wants to scream at him
He wants to tell him that it isn’t fair it isn’t right that he takes such good care of Tucker when he should be the one taking care of Wash
It’s all he wants
It’s all he wants to be the one brushing Wash’s hair out of his eyes to be pulling back the sheets on Wash’s bed and tucking him in but he isn’t he doesn’t know how he doesn’t know what to say and even if Tucker could find the right words his throat is too tight to let any of them out
He keeps his eyes closed as he feels Wash pull away from him the distance stretching wider and wider as Wash crosses his room and shuts the door as Wash crosses the hall and opens the door to his own room
Tucker stands furious and sudden grabs the foot of his bed and yanks hard
He tugs the whole thing away from the wall inch by inch and wrenches it around until it faces the window
It’s crooked and messy and smack in the middle of the room but Tucker doesn’t care just collapses right on top of the sheets
There looking at the starlight falling across the foot of his bed and listening to the sounds of Wash and Caboose moving in their respective rooms Tucker closes his eyes and drifts off into an uneasy sleep
You seem distracted today
Even as the words register it takes some time for Wash to respond to them
He’s staring intently at a painting hanging on the wall of Dr Grey’s office letting the bright colors and bumpy texture soothe his mind
The painting is simple depicting a flock of birds lifting off from a grassy field
Wash thinks they’re some species of crow although these birds have bright blue eyes and are much larger than the ones back on Earth
Where did you get that
Dr Grey follows his gaze
The painting
I found it actually
It was hanging on the wall of one of the bombed-out houses on the east side of Armonia
Perfectly preserved right in the middle of the blood and bones
How did you get it here
Although Wash is still staring transfixed at the painting he can hear the smile deepen in Dr Grey’s voice
The Colonel fetched it for me
Found the exact house by my description alone
Goodness only knows how he got it back here but well I walked into my office one day and there it was
Wash nods absently
The thought of Sarge lugging an enormous painting across a war-torn Armonia for his lover is one of the least ridiculous things he’s heard of the sim troopers doing
Why do you like it
I love birds Dr Grey says simply
They’re beautiful
Oh Wash says then considers
Birds are nice I guess
Wash
He sighs dragging his gaze away from the painting reluctantly
What
What’s on your mind
Nothing he says automatically then manages a weak smile at her lifted eyebrow
I just
I don’t want to talk about it
Okay she says easily
We can talk about birds some more if you like
Wash’s eyes flick over toward the painting again
You have a tattoo of one on your shoulder
A bird
I do Dr Grey says sounding a bit surprised
How do you know that
He rolls his eyes giving her a pointed look and after a moment her face cracks into a grin
Oooh yes
When you waltzed into this very office while Ollie and I were making love
Wash groans burying his face in his hands
You know what never mind
I regret bringing that up
She laughs
Do you have any tattoos
Wash lifts his face from his hands
No actually
Hmmm she says sounding surprised
You know I think you’re one of the only ones in this army who doesn’t
Definitely the only one of your friends
Wash frowns slightly running through everyone and their tattoos mentally
Even Simmons
Even Simmons
I’ve thought about it Wash says thoughtfully
Many times
It just never seemed totally right
They lapse into a comfortable silence once more and when Dr Grey speaks up again he does not tense
Would you like to talk about what’s bothering now
Or shall we talk a bit more about tattoos
Wash shrugs
I
I’m fine
Tattoos
Tattoos sound good
Okay she says easily adjusting more comfortably in her seat
So what sort of tattooshave you considered getting in the past
It’s just it’s stupid
Dr Grey tilts her head at him
What’s stupid
Wash shrugs hands twisting and untwisting in the sleeves of his hoodie
It’s stupid he mutters again
Stupid for me to talk about what I’m feeling or what happened to me
It’s not stupid Dr Grey says firmly
You’re in pain
That’s never stupid
Well I shouldn’t be in pain
You have every right
No I don’t
It shouldn’t be this hard Wash snaps
Anger floods through him vicious and hot and he turns to the window glaring out at the bright sun
It shouldn’t it’s not fair
You’re right
It’s not
No it’sthat’s not what I you don’t understand
Then make me understand
Wash turns away from the window as quickly as he turned to look out of it the red sunlight suddenly overwhelming
Blue
He needs blue cool and soothing and he reaches for the blue pen on Dr Grey’s desk turning it over and over in his hands
He focuses on it when he says It’s not fair that I’m in pain because people died
She says nothing and Wash clicks the pen cap open and closed open and closed
People died
Trying to find me
That’s what matters
Not what happened to me
I’m alive
I get to live
He doesn’t mean for the words to come out so bitter but he does not try to take them back either
Wash Dr Grey says softly and something in her voice has Wash looking up
When he does he is startled to see her eyes shining with unshed tears
Yes there are others whose suffering may be comparatively greater than yours and there are others still who are no longer around to suffer butWash
That does not mean that you don’t get to suffer too
You have a right to your pain
He’s clenching the pen so tightly that it starts to crack in his fist and Dr Grey puts her hand on his until he muscles relax and he looks up to meet her eyes
You have a right she says to heal
Wash doesn’t hide the tears he knows are shining in his own eyes or the tremor in his voice as he says I don’t know if I believe you
I know she says
I know you don’t
But you must try
You get to live and that means you must try
I just never thought
Wash takes a deep breath and starts again
I always knew they would come for me
The the Reds and Blues
That’s what they do
I even knew Carolina would come because we we can’t not
But I neverI never You never thought the other soldiers would come for you Dr Grey says softly
The Federalist and New Republic soldiers
Wash nods unable to speak and she continues
Wash I’m not sure if anyone has told you this but there were people lining up for you
That mission was volunteer only and there was no shortage
They shouldn’t have done that Wash says at once
Not for me
I
I didn’t even want to stay here
I wanted to grab them my friends and leave
Run away as fast and as far as we could
I would have left every single person here to die and I wouldn’t have looked back
And now
And nowand now Silence
He clenches his hand around the pen once more
I
I’m not sure if I could leave he says slowly
But I would still choose them
The Reds and Blues
If I had to
If it came down to it
Wash
So you see
He laughs bitter
I don’t deserve those people lining up for me
I don’t deserve this
I don’t deserve that kind of of loyalty when I’ve done nothing for the soldiers on this planet
That’s not true Dr Grey says firmly
You have done wonders for this army
For both sides
I was there in that Federalist compound remember
I watched you train those soldiers day after day
I didn’t have a choice Wash mutters
I knew that’s what I had to do to get my men back
We always have a choice she says and you chose to train those soldiers to the best of your ability
You could have done so half-heartedly but you didn’t
You taught them how to protect themselves
You did the same for the cadets when you arrived here
He shrugs throat tight
I still would have left
If Tucker and Caboose if any of them had wanted to leave I would have left
Dr Grey is already shaking her head
You are being far too hard on yourself
Wash everyone has someone they would choose over another person
When the coin is in the air when the finger is on the trigger we all have those we would place above all others
That’s what every single one of the simulation troopers as well as Agent Carolina did when they left to get you the second time
Consciously or not they made a choice and they chose you
The fact that you are able to admit your choices so starkly is shockingly honest but it does not make you a terrible person and it certainly does not make you unworthy of loyalty or love
Her words are wrapping around him falling warm and soft on his ears and settling somewhere in his chest
It is some time before he can speak
I just
I hate that they died
I would do anything to change that
I know
How do you live with it he asks her
What do you do with that kind of pain
Many things Dr Grey says and her eyes are bright once more
But first you must allow yourself to feel it
When Wash leaves Dr Grey’s office an hour later he turns down the the quietest hallway he can find and stops at a large window leaning against it
There are places he needs to go people he needs to see but he needs this first the quiet and the feel of the windowpane cool against his forehead
Wash doesn’t stay there for long pushing off the windowsill purposefully and striding to Blue Team’s hallway
No one stops him for which Wash is grateful as he knows he needs to do this now
He knocks boldly on Caboose’s door the moment he approaches it because he knows that if he doesn’t do it immediately he never will
He is not going to stand outside in this hallway fumbling for words like a fool
Caboose is his friend
Caboose deserves better than that
Caboose
Has the world’s biggest eyes whenever he’s sad Wash remembers in a panic as Caboose opens the door and stares at him morosely
Wash thinks he could handle it if they were puppy eyes but they’re not they’re solemn and serious and cutting straight through to Wash’s heart
Um
Hi Caboose
Hello Agent Washington
Wash swallows reaching an unconscious hand up to the back of his neck before forcing it back down
Hey buddy
Can I come in
Yes Caboose says quickly in that tone he has the one that suggests he’ll listen to anything Wash has to say
Wash recognizes that guilty tone immediately
It’s the same one he used to use on Donut the same one that he still uses on Donut when he’s not careful
He hates it
He hates that it’s coming out of Caboose’s mouth hates the implications of it hates everything about this situation right down to frown lines marking Caboose’s forehead
Wash follows Caboose into his room anyway realizing as he does so that it’s his first time in here
He isn’t sure what he was expecting drawings on the wall a mess to rival Tucker’s the furniture rearranged
What he wasn’t expecting was for the room to be so tidy everything straightened bed made perfectly crisp
Wash does not dwell on these details for too long but that’s only because of the walls
They’re covered absolutely covered in pictures all spaced out neatly in perfect lines
There’s Church sniper rifle held tight to his chest in the same way Wash so often sees Caboose hold Freckles
Tex with her hands on her hips glaring up at a huge tank
Tucker looking exasperated at the camera while putting his dreads up
Carolina laughing at something Epsilon said in the training room
The Reds
The Feds
The News
Kimball and Doyle arguing with each other in a meeting
And Wash himself everywhere he looks
Reaching down a hand to help Tucker up after a sparring match in the canyon
Standing watch on the perimeter of Chorus battle rifle held loosely in his hands
In the mess hall head thrown back as he laughs at something Grif said
For a while Wash forgets why he came to Caboose’s room staring transfixed at all of the photographs
These are beautiful
They are
Even the pictures taken at random are composed beautifully and the lighting itself is a work of art
How did you take these
How did you print them
There is a very very nice camera installed in my helmet
I can take pictures just by blinking my eyes so I also get them at the right moment
It’s ah
It’s how I get such good pictures of everything for Casebook
Basebook Wash mutters absentmindedly
I printed them on the supply run
Wash pulls his gaze away from the pictures exasperated
Is there anything you guys don’t do on the supply runs
No
Of course not Wash sighs
Well they’re amazing Caboose
Thank you Agent Washington Caboose mutters and it’s his somber tone of voice that snaps Wash out of his reverie
Wash takes a seat awkwardly on one of the upturned crates in Caboose’s room
It has a pillow on it and everything as if it was placed with company in mind and Caboose sits down on the crate across from him
Caboose I I want to talk to you
Okay Caboose says and he sounds so depressed that it’s frankly jarring
Wash frowns
Caboose why do you sound like that
Sound like what
Sound sosoupset
Because Caboose says mournfully
Because you are about to tell me that you don’t want to be friends anymore and I am about to be very sad because I think you are a very good friend even though I am not
Caboose Wash interrupts stricken
He already can’t take this
Yyou are not a bad friend don’t say that
Caboose makes a noise of polite disbelief
Ah yes but
See I think I might be
You had to get a very scary surgery that you might not have needed if I had not hugged you
I
I told you that wasokay Wash says awkwardly
When I woke up remember
No you didn’t Caboose corrects
What you said was it’s okay kinda needed a hug could maybe use one now and I said you could
And you said yeah think so and that is not the same thing as me not being a bad friend
Wash closes his eyes briefly
Caboose you are not a bad friend
Caboose says nothing just stares at him doubtfully
There’s a weird panic brewed up in Wash’s chest because although Caboose is far from perfect he is a good friend the best kind of friend and the thought of him not knowing that is unbearable
Okay Caboose says slowly although he doesn’t sound like he buys it in the slightest
See I thought that too
I thought that I was a good friend the best kind of friend but I was not careful when we found you like I should have been
Caboose casts that owlish gaze on him and Wash nods dumbly and says I know that for lack of absolutely anything else to say
Just when Wash thinks Caboose is done speaking he continues abruptly
Is Tucker your best friend
Wash doesn’t have to think on that one
You’re both my best friend Caboose
Yeeeeeah Caboose says thinking
Yeah
You know I did not think until I met you that people could have two best friends
Bu now I know that you can have more than two you can have a whole bunch
Wash finds himself temporarily unable to speak but that’s okay because Caboose keeps going
If Tucker is not your best friend then why do you and Tucker have a secret word
I what
Because that is a thing that best friends have
They have secret bracelets or hand signals or words and well
That is a thing that you and Tucker have that you and I do not
And when you said your secret word Tucker stopped moving and I did not
Wash sees all at once where this is going and tries to backtrack
Caboose that that wasn’t he just
I we Caboose waits patiently for him to stutter himself into silence
Why did he know to stop
Oh God
He’s going to have to do it
He’s going to have to look Caboose in the eye and have a conversation about safe words and what they mean and why he and Tucker have one
Well Wash says slowly
Tucker and I are well we’re we’re Any hopes he had of Caboose helping him out are quickly dashed when Caboose usually content to chatter on happily stares at him in dead silence with those solemn serious eyes
He’s listening patiently waiting for Wash to explain so that he can understand and that’s what does it
He wants to understand wants to know why Tucker knew what he did not and Wash will not patronize him will not leave him in the dark over something that is so clearly ripping him up inside
Caboose
You know that Tucker and I are He hesitates once more this time for lack of proper terminology
They had never discussed what they were really although it was clearly not a secret
Wash isn’t actually sure if Tucker is the kind of person for whom labels are important
Boyfriends Wash finally says awkwardly
Partners
You know
Dating
Or something
Oh Caboose says sounding mildly surprised and Wash frowns
Did you not know that
Oh no Caboose says earnestly
I knew
I actually lost a lot of money because the two of you took so long to become boyfriends because you were being stupid
You were in on that
And it was very obvious because you were always kissing and looking at each other with very big eyes like Church used to look at Tex and the way Carolina looks at General Kimball so
Wait what
 so the entire planet knows that you two used to be boyfriends
Tucker has kissed a lot of people and it is very annoying but he kisses people differently when he is their boyfriend
See when he is sad and angry he kisses people he should not kiss to get sleepy like when you and Sarge and Donut and Lopez were not here
He kisses boyfriends and girlfriends when he’s happy like when he kissed the nice yellow lady in Blood Valley or like when he used to kiss you
That’s how everyone knew
It takes a few seconds for Wash to respond as he’s rapidly running through every time he’s been the same room as Carolina and Kimball and trying to remember them making eyes at each other
Wait used to be boyfriends
Well Caboose says well now I am not so sure because you have not been spending any nights together and you don’t kiss or hold hands anymore and you don’t talk to Tucker so
Caboose we’re stilltogether
Even as he says it more guilt worms its way into his stomach guilt at the complete lack of affection he’s been showing Tucker
He shelves that thought for later and continues trying to focus on the conversation at hand
So you know that when two people are together they do physicallyintimatethings
The beast with two backs Caboose says serenely
That’s what Sarge calls it
Of course he does Wash sighs
Wellwhen you’re doing moreintensephysically intimate things with someone it’s a good idea to have a a safe word
Something that you can say if you get uncomfortable or or scared or just want to stop
That’s why Tucker knew to stop because red was ourour
Your secret word our safe yes
That
Exactly
Hmm Caboose says and Wash fidgets in embarrassed silence while Caboose ponders this
Do you have to be dating someone to have a secret word
I
Wash pauses
Well Isuppose not no
Can we have a secret word
When Wash stares at him Caboose continues sitting up a little straighter on his crate
See I think that would be a good idea
If you and I had had a secret best friend word then you could have said it and I would have held very very still and not hurt you
I
Sometimes I do not like loud noises Caboose says seriously
And and if we had a secret word and I said it then maybe you could yell at everyone to be quiet
Or we could go somewhere else
And then when you forget your name or where you are or you do not want a hug then you could say it I will know
I think that would be nice
Right Wash says helplessly then steels himself
Yes Caboose
Let’s do that
What would you like our secret word to be
Does it have to be a color
No
It should just be something simple
Something easy to say that wouldn’t normally come up in conversation
They both fall silent for a while thinking hard
Wash’s mind is utterly blank and several minutes pass
Wash is just starting to despair when Caboose says Maximillian
Wash stares at him
Maximillian
Caboose nods
That is the name of my first pet
He was a hamster and he died and it made me very sad and I do not like to talk about him
Oh Wash says
Well
That
That certainly works I don’t think that that’s a word that would come up in casual conversation
So that’s it
Caboose asks brightly
That’s our secret word
Really
Yes Wash says and he can’t help but grin at the ecstatic look on Caboose’s face
Feel better
Oh Wash I
I feel much better Caboose says earnestly
I still feel very sad that I did a stupid thing and I understand if you do not want to forgive me
Of course I forgive you Wash hastens to assure him
Caboose we’ve we’ve all done stupid things
Not that stupid
Yes Wash says firmly
Yes that stupid
Caboose doesn’t look completely convinced but he nods and stands serenely smoothing his hands over the pillow
I am glad we talked Agent Washington he says and I am very glad that you are back
When he reaches out to hug Wash it is a careful gentle thing soft hands and sure lines and Wash leans into it without even thinking
He recalls with sudden clarity of the first time that Caboose had hugged him after a nightmare back on Rockslide remembers how he’d stood there frozen and stunned and completely unable to pull away
He is not frozen now as his own arms wrap around Caboose
He is not stunned as Caboose rests his cheek on Wash’s shoulder not stunned at all because this is what Caboose does hug his friends his best friends and of course Wash is included in that because
Because he is Caboose’s friend
He is one of Caboose’s best friends
There is no question in his mind and Wash finds himself marveling over this as he and Caboose break apart
Not the knowledge or the sentiment that Caboose considers him a best friend but
But the fact that he does not doubt it
He doesn’t doubt it at all
It takes Wash some time to find Tucker later that afternoon and it’s by sheer chance that he peeks into the training room
Once he sees Tucker in there hard at work with his wooden training sword Wash feels rather guilty for not checking there in the first place
Tucker has come a long way from the lazy mouthy soldier who would do anything he could to get out of training
He may not like it but he very rarely tries to shirk his duties anymore
Wash slips quietly into the gym and takes a seat along the bench by the back wall
At first he thinks that Tucker is running through katas by himself but after some searching Wash’s eyes land on another figure watching him holding a second wooden sword
Dr Tronosky of all people
Wash’s eyebrows shoot up his forehead and he hears a snort somewhere to his left
He glances over to see Kimball approaching him from the weight benches snagging a towel off of the wall and wiping her forehead
She gestures towards Dr Tronosky who is now attempting to a show a very unhappy looking Tucker something with his sword
Did you come to watch the show
I Wash gapes as the doctor moves through the kata himself
Does he know how to use one of those
Apparently he used to fence
Kimball drops heavily onto the bench next to Wash turning her gaze to the floor where Tucker is watching Dr Tronosky with his arms folded tightly across his chest
Carolina assigned him and Tucker to train together five days out of the week
Tucker didn’t tell me that Wash says frowning
Neither did Carolina
He can feel Kimball’s gaze flick towards him
I’m sure they thought you had enough on your plate Wash
Well yeah but He trails off watching as Tucker stormily begins the kata again
This time Dr Tronosky stops him halfway through and Wash can hear Tucker’s groan of frustration from across the room
I am shifting my weight
I still would’ve liked to know Wash says finally
I’m just surprised he didn’t tell me is all
Apparently Tucker isn’t too thrilled about it
I can see that Wash says as Tucker actually throws down his sword in frustration
The silence that settles between him and Kimball isn’t as awkward as Wash would have expected but he shifts uncomfortably nonetheless
I’m sorry he says suddenly and she turns to look at him with a frown
Wash if you’re about to apologize for being taken prisoner then well I can’t say I’m surprised but I really wish you wouldn’t
Not for that
I mean I am it was a stupid mistake that got me shot but no
I’m sorry for thethe people who
Wash swallows
The people who died on that mission
Kimball goes very still before turning slowly to face him
You heard about that
Wash nods and she sighs
How
He gives her a look
General please
There are no secrets in this army
True she allows
Wash I don’t blame you for that mission
To be frank it seems pretty silly that you’re blaming yourself for something that you didn’t even know about until after the fact
But
No she says sharply
No buts
There are two people to blame for that mission and that is myself and General Doyle
Tucker and Carolina may have pushed for it before we were ready but Doyle and I let ourselves be pushed
We gave the okay
The burden is ours
It’s heavy enough to shoulder without me having to reassure you of that
Wash nods
He can certainly understand that
I’m sorry
Don’t apologize Kimball says her voice still sharp
Not just to me but to any of them
They deserve your thanks not your apologies
This time Wash falls silent and after a moment she sighs
I would like to apologize to you though
It did take us an unforgivably long time to find you andand I’m sure you’ve heard by now that I locked the base down
I did
He frowns at her a little
General I don’t resent you for that
It was a tactical move and
It wasn’t
Her voice has not changed but there is a new tension in her jawline as she looks away
After a moment she speaks again
It was not a tactical decision
It was as emotional one just as emotional as Captain Tucker’s was to find you
I didn’t do it for the army
I did it because because every time one of them dies a piece of me goes too
She gestures across the room to where a group of cadets are clustered
From the looks of things Prajapati is attempting to show Britton how to spare with only one arm
Britton is giggling madly falling all over Kennedy who is holding her up and grinning dumbly while Prajapati rolls her eyes
Bitters is attempting to direct from the sidelines while Jensen shushes him and Palomo is rolling on the floor laughing at something he just said
Wash thinks back to what Dr Grey said about how each of them had those who they’d choose first always when their back was to the wall
I wanted to leave you know he says suddenly
When we first arrived on Chorus
I didn’t want to stay
Kimball tears her gaze away from the cadets to roll her eyes at him
I know that Agent Washington
You aren’t subtle
He winces
Do you think everyone else knew too
Yes she says
It didn’t stop them from lining up for you while you were gone
So I keep hearing Wash says
You stayed though she continues
Regardless of your reasons you stayed and you’ve kept more than one of them alive
For that you have my gratitude
When she holds out her hand Wash doesn’t hesitate to shake it
And you have my service General
For as long as I’m able to give it
There’s a loud clatter across the room and they look up just in time to see Tucker’s sword hit the wall as he stalks off
Dr Tronosky watches him go with a sigh then trudges wearily across the gym
Kimball rises claps him on the shoulder and with a final nod to Wash crosses the room to her cadets
Dr Tronosky sits down in her vacated seat staring blankly at the opposing wall
He looks so defeated so very human in that moment that Wash can’t help but grin
How’s he doing
The doctor jolts himself out of his reverie removing his glasses and rubbing a hand across his eyes
Oh
Tucker’s very physically gifted
I’m rather impressed with how well he’s done with that sword with no training actually
He’s just Stubborn
Dr Tronosky gives him a look
Something like that
You have my sympathy
There’s also the fact that Tucker doesn’t like me very much
Sure he does Wash says then grins when Tronosky’s look grows even more exasperated
Okay fine
But it’s not that he doesn’t like you he’s just
Protective Tronosky says
It’s nice
It’s nice to see that
I don’t begrudge him
It seems like he could be a little nicer
Tronosky laughs
I don’t think I’d like him as much if he were
Before Wash can ask him to elaborate Dr Tronosky stands
I believe Tucker stormed off to the showers
He should be out shortly if you’d like to wait for him
I think I will
Wash smiles up at him
Thanks
With a final smile Dr Tronosky leaves but not before re-racking his and Tucker’s training weapons
Wash turns his attention to Kimball and the cadets all of whom are listening intently as Kimball demonstrates a few ways to break wrist holds using only one hand
His stomach still clenches whenever he catches sight of Britton’s severed arm but he can’t help grinning at the enthusiastic way they all throw themselves into the training or the way Kimball A loud boom sounds with no warning startling them all to their feet
Wash locks eyes with Kimball momentarily as the two of them sprint to the door as one the rest of the training room not far behind
That came from the armory Kimball says testily and they tear down the hallway and push through the doorway
To find Sarge batting at a small fire coughing and waving his hands at them
Nothing to worry about
Got a little project I’m working on nothing to see nothing to see
Sarge for heaven’s sake that’s the third time this week
As Kimball storms into the armory and the cadets cluster in the doorway Wash finds his gaze drawn towards the small fire that Donut is desperately trying to put out
While it isn’t large he can feel the heat from here and he skitters backwards before his brain catches up with his instincts
Felix’s hand fists harder in his hair the more Wash thrashes strands catching in the gauntlets and tearing from his scalp
He tries to ignore Locus watching him closely just behind the camera tries to keep his gaze focused on the blinking green light tries to think of friends that are watching just beyond it
He tries he tries but the pain is lighting up his nerves and he’s starting to panic
The space pirate is dragging the lighter along his side and someone is trying to break the door down on the other side and he’s forgetting every bit of RTI training he’s ever received as he screams
No
No
This isn’t Freelancer that isn’t Maine crashing through the door to save his ass yet again no one is crashing through the door he is alone here in this room and Felix’s voice is too close to his ear and there’s a horrible smell filling the room the smell of his own burning hair
Wash
Wash startles hard stumbling out of the armory and slamming right into someone just behind him
He flinches away hands flying up to the back of his neck as he whirls to meet Tucker’s wide eyes
Wash
A wall
He needs his back to a wall now he needs to watch his six and protect his implants
He stumbles clumsily backwards searching searching and can’t stop another flinch when Tucker’s hands come to rest on his shoulders
It’s okay
It’s okay
Look just
Tucker guides him carefully down the hallway until Wash feels his shoulders press into the cool cinderblock wall
He glances around to make sure that no one is approaching that it’s just him and Tucker his hands curl into fists and he can still smell it his hair burning burning burning
Wash
Breathe
Tucker catches one of his flailing hands and tugs it to his chest holding it there
Wash flattens his hand out pressing his palm firmly against Tucker’s chest until he can feel his heartbeat
He focuses on the steady vibrations on the warmth of Tucker’s skin through his t-shirt and breathes
Your back is to a wall he tells himself firmly
Your back is to a wall and it’s only smoke you smell not flesh
Not your own flesh and hair
His other hand comes up to cup the back of his neck fingertips running over the uneven singed strands
Tucker’s hand follows his own clamping down gently over his implants and Wash breathes counts mentally to ten to the cadence of Tucker’s heart
They stand there in silence for some time once Wash’s breathing returns to normal the sounds of Kimball’s yelling and still filtering down the hallway amidst crashes and what Wash thinks is the spray of a fire extinguisher
His hand is still pressed to Tucker’s chest Tucker’s fingers folded protectively over his own and he stares at them for a while at how warm and soothing Tucker’s dark skin looks
A particularly loud bang has them both jolting and Wash gives his head a shake tugging his hand back
I’m fine
There is a shift in Tucker’s eyes at once a hardening around the edges but all he says is okay
I Wash clears his throat
Thank you Tucker
Stop Tucker says his voice sharpening along with his eyes
Don’t don’t thank me
I don’t want you to thank me for stuff like that
Wash nods automatically pushing away from the wall and Tucker backs off
I have to go
Tucker frowns a little but makes no move to keep him there beyond raising a hand and letting it fall
Okay just just be careful
You look a little woozy dude
I’m fine Wash insists
It’s no big deal
You sure you don’t want to talk about it
There’s nothing to talk about it
That was nothing
It was
It was nothing has to be nothing because his skin is still crawling and despite Dr Grey’s words he doesn’t think he can let himself have this just yet
If he doesn’t think about it if he doesn’t talk about it then
Tucker grits his teeth his words cutting through Wash’s thoughts
You just had a panic attack Wash
That wasn’t nothing
I have panic attacks all the time Tucker
That doesn’t make them nothing
Shit I don’t even know what that was about because you won’t fucking talk to me about it
I don’t want to talk about it Wash says sharper than he intended
I told you I’m fine
Stop saying that
Tucker doesn’t quite yell it but it’s loud enough to make the cadets exiting the armory glance their way
They scatter when Tucker glares at them before turning back to Wash
Wash I swear to God if you tell me you’re fine one more fucking time
But I am
Wash insists
I am fine
Great Tucker says
He rakes a shaky hand through his hair
That’s that’s great you know that you’re fine and I’m really fucking happy for you but what about me
Wash’s heart plummets straight through the floor
Tucker
I don’t get it Tucker continues still in that same shaky voice
I don’t see how you can be fine after what happened when I’m when I’m
He turns away arms folded tightly across his chest
Wash reaches out a hesitant hand towards his shoulder and lets it fall
Tucker I have to go Tucker says abruptly
I just
I’ll talk to you later okay
As Wash watches Tucker walk away Caboose’s words about the entire planet knowing they used to be boyfriends echoes back to him
The conversation catches in his mind prickling there and for a long uneasy moment he’s certain he missed something important in Caboose’s words though he can’t remember what
The moment passes and he wonders just as uneasily if Tucker has grown uncertain of his place in Wash’s life
Wash can’t blame him if that is the case he’s done nothing to assure Tucker otherwise made no effort to talk to him or have any type of physical contact
He needs to do better move faster if he doesn’t want Tucker to keep walking away from him for good
Wash tucks that thought away as he turns sighing to walk in the opposite direction
He will consider it carefully later weigh his options come up with a plan to let Tucker know that he doesn’t want to go anywhere
Now there is something that he needs to do
Chorus is cold tonight
It is unseasonably chilly or at least Wash thinks so
He hasn’t been on this planet long enough to have a full understanding of how Chorus cycled through its seasons but he thinks they are in the middle of what’s supposed to be summer
Tonight though the day’s sunny skies have turned grey and lifeless clouds heavy with what Wash can only hope is rain
There isn’t a soul outside aside from those keeping watch on the perimeter and even those soldiers pay him no mind as Wash walks across the darkening base
He isn’t certain if they recognize him or not he’s wrapped up in one of Grif’s old sweatshirts the hood drawn tightly over his head
Grif had taken pity on him in the early days at the crash site during another sudden cold spell
They’d exchanged a look of dull understanding while Tucker had sauntered around the entire day in a tank top and sweat pants dropping snarky comments about how it wasn’t that cold out
Grif had never asked for the hoodie back and hadn’t even said anything when he’d seen Wash wearing it around base since then
Wash supposes it belongs to him now
It occurs to him as he walks across the silent base that it’s one of the few objects he can truly call his own
If the guards recognize him they do not stop him and Wash is able to approach the war memorial uninterrupted
There are no graves here if there is one thing that the armies agreed on it was that all bodies must be burned only two huge metal slabs covered with names and dates
The first is more official looking a neatly erected slab with the names and dates of those deceased stamped into it
It’s the second memorial that Wash is drawn to the one that he knows the rebels had hastily built when they’d arrived at the capital
It’s a simple scrap of metal looking as if it’s torn from crashed Pelican the names and dates scratched into it with knives or fire or even in some cases sketched out with bullet holes
He can’t help but notice that there are both New Republic and Federalist names on here and that the more official memorial seems to have been abandoned in favor of the newer one
In addition to the names and dates there are messages symbols and even drawings
Wash’s eyes linger for a while on Fitz’s name
Thomas Fitz complete with a small sketch of him that Wash recognizes at once as Ali’s style
Nearly ten minutes pass before Wash can bring himself to locate the date of the disastrous first attempt to rescue him
The names of the nine who died are all grouped together each one written in a different handwriting
Wash reads each one
He whispers them into the cold evening air runs his fingers over the metal brings each face to mind and commits it to memory
Federalist soldiers that he spent months passing in the hallways of that base
New Republic cadets who he’d watched steadily improve day by day drill bye drill obstacle course by obstacle course
Soldiers that he knew relatively well and some that hardly knew at all
Young
Every single one of them far too young from Private Laura O’Leary at age eighteen to Captain Dominic Ling age thirty-three
The mission was volunteer only Kimball told him stiffly and although she hadn’t said so Wash could see plainly in her eyes that she hadn’t agreed with it
He wonders why she and Doyle let them go why they had as she’d said let themselves be convinced
Wonders if this has something to do with the guilt in Tucker’s voice when he’d told Wash he’d gotten people killed
Wash’s eyes travel downward to the base of the memorial to where there are dozens and dozens of seemingly innocuous objects piled
Bracelets and pins cracked datapads and dead flowers shirts and boots
Dog tags
Stuffed animals
Old school trophies
An engagement ring
The sorrow hits Wash unexpectedly twisting up his stomach and burning black in the center of his skull until he’s pressing his forehead against the metal eyes squeezed shut
It’s nothing nothing compared to the guilt guilt that he was so very close to turning his back on this planet guilt that he is the sole reason that nine people are dead
Guilt that he has nothing to give them
It’s a long time before he is able to trust his own two legs to hold him and pushes shakily away from the wall
He glances again between the names and the beloved objects at the base their simplicity rooting him to the spot
He can’t leave
He can’t not until
It’s with an unconscious desperation that Wash begins to pat up and down his body searching for something anything that he could leave them
He is just starting to despair when his fingers catch in the drawstring of Grif’s hoodie
He slides it free from the hood and ties it methodically in a knot brushing his lips against it ever so slightly before he places the string on top of a tin coffee can
I’m sorry he whispers so softly that no one would be able to hear him even if they were standing nearby
Despite Kimball’s words he can’t not say it to them at least once
I’m so sorry and and thank you
There is no reason that he should be able to see the black string in his mind so clearly but it seems to call to him even as he walks away a piece of him left behind with little pieces of so many others
